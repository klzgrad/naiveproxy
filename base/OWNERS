# About src/base:
#
# Chromium is a very mature project, most things that are generally useful are
# already here, and that things not here aren't generally useful.
#
# Base is pulled into many projects. For example, various ChromeOS daemons. So
# the bar for adding stuff is that it must have demonstrated wide
# applicability. Prefer to add things closer to where they're used (i.e. "not
# base"), and pull into base only when needed.  In a project our size,
# sometimes even duplication is OK and inevitable.
#
# Adding a new logging macro DPVELOG_NE is not more clear than just
# writing the stuff you want to log in a regular logging statement, even
# if it makes your calling code longer. Just add it to your own code.
#
# If the code in question does not need to be used inside base, but will have
# multiple consumers across the codebase, consider placing it in a new directory
# under components/ instead.
