// S13nServiceWorker:
// Represents a service worker that is a controller.  One of its Mojo end
// points (i.e. the caller end) is passed to the controllee in the renderer
// process, and used from there.  Its other Mojo end point (i.e. the destination
// of the events) is currently implemented by BrowserSideControllerServiceWorker
// in the browser-process, but eventually this should be implemented by the
// controller service worker in the renderer-process so that the events
// dispatched by the controllees can be directly sent there.
//
// The controllees use this interface to directly talk to the controller. This
// implements a small subset of ServiceWorkerEventDispatcher, namely dispatch
// methods for Fetch and PostMessage, because ordering must be preserved
// between them: controller.postMessage(...), controller.fetch(‘...’); from
// the page must result in a message event then fetch event dispatched to the
// service worker. They are believed to be the only events whose ordering
// guarantee is observable from the page context.
//
interface ControllerServiceWorker {
  // Dispatches Fetch event for sub-resources. (Fetch for main resource is
  // handled by ServiceWorkerEventDispatcher, as the fetch is initiated
  // in the browser-process during the navigation)
  // The callback is called once the event finishes, which means the event
  // handler ran and all outstanding respondWith() and waitUntil() promises have
  // settled. |response_callback| is called once the promise to respondWith()
  // settles, or when the event handler ran without calling respondWith().
