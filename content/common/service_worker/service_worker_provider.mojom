// ServiceWorkerWorkerClient represents a service worker client that is a worker
// (i.e., a shared worker or dedicated worker). We use this interface to let the
// WorkerFetchContextImpl in the worker thread know about the change of
// controlling service worker by calling SetControllerServiceWorker() from the
// ServiceWorkerProviderContext in the main thread of the renderer process.
//
// TODO(horo): We should implement ServiceWorkerProvider in the worker thread
// instead of using this interface to support WorkerNavigator.serviceWorker
// when we can make the worker thread totally independent from the main thread.
// Currently we handle synchronous resource loading such as importScripts() and
// synchronous XHR in the main thread. So we need to know whether the worker is
// controlled by a service worker or not both in the main thread and in the
// worker thread.
