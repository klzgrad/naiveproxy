// A block file is a file designed to store blocks of data of a given size. It
// is able to store data that spans from one to four consecutive "blocks", and
// it grows as needed to store up to approximately 65000 blocks. It has a fixed
// size header used for book keeping such as tracking free of blocks on the
// file. For example, a block-file for 1KB blocks will grow from 8KB when
// totally empty to about 64MB when completely full. At that point, data blocks
// of 1KB will be stored on a second block file that will store the next set of
// 65000 blocks. The first file contains the number of the second file, and the
// second file contains the number of a third file, created when the second file
// reaches its limit. It is important to remember that no matter how long the
// chain of files is, any given block can be located directly by its address,
// which contains the file number and starting block inside the file.

// where did we find the last entry of that type (to avoid searching the bitmap

// Sparse data support:
// We keep a two level hierarchy to enable sparse data for an entry: the first
// level consists of using separate "child" entries to store ranges of 1 MB,
// and the second level stores blocks of 1 KB inside each child entry.
//
// Whenever we need to access a particular sparse offset, we first locate the
// child entry that stores that offset, so we discard the 20 least significant
// bits of the offset, and end up with the child id. For instance, the child id
// to store the first megabyte is 0, and the child that should store offset
// 0x410000 has an id of 4.
//
// The child entry is stored the same way as any other entry, so it also has a
// name (key). The key includes a signature to be able to identify children
// created for different generations of the same resource. In other words, given
// that a given sparse entry can have a large number of child entries, and the
// resource can be invalidated and replaced with a new version at any time, it
// is important to be sure that a given child actually belongs to certain entry.
//
// The full name of a child entry is composed with a prefix ("Range_"), and two
// hexadecimal 64-bit numbers at the end, separated by semicolons. The first
// number is the signature of the parent key, and the second number is the child
// id as described previously. The signature itself is also stored internally by
// the child and the parent entries. For example, a sparse entry with a key of
// "sparse entry name", and a signature of 0x052AF76, may have a child entry
// named "Range_sparse entry name:052af76:4", which stores data in the range
// 0x400000 to 0x4FFFFF.
//
// Each child entry keeps track of all the 1 KB blocks that have been written
// to the entry, but being a regular entry, it will happily return zeros for any
// read that spans data not written before. The actual sparse data is stored in
// one of the data streams of the child entry (at index 1), while the control
// information is stored in another stream (at index 2), both by parents and
// the children.

// This structure contains the control information for parent and child entries.
// It is stored at offset 0 of the data stream with index 2.
// It is possible to write to a child entry in a way that causes the last block
// to be only partialy filled. In that case, last_block and last_block_len will
// keep track of that block.
