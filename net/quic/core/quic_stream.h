// The base class for client/server QUIC streams.

// It does not contain the entire interface needed by an application to interact
// with a QUIC stream.  Some parts of the interface must be obtained by
// accessing the owning session object.  A subclass of QuicStream
// connects the object and the application that generates and consumes the data
// of the stream.

// The QuicStream object has a dependent QuicStreamSequencer object,
// which is given the stream frames as they arrive, and provides stream data in
// order by invoking ProcessRawData().
