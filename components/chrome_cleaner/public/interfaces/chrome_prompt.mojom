// IMPORTANT NOTE: Avoid adding dependencies to typemapped .mojom files.
// Enabling typemaps currently (as of July 2017) requires indirectly depending
// on all existing typemap definitions. The Chrome Cleaner is built
// independently from Chromium and would like to avoid these dependencies.

// Once it's possible to specify a limited subset of typemaps to use, be
// careful not to add dependencies to [Native] mojo structures. The wire format
// for [Native] structs is not guaranteed to be consistent between versions.
