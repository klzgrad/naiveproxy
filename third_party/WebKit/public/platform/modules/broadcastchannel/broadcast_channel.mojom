// This interface is used to set up connections to broadcast channels. All

// Typically the browser will have one instance of a BroadcastChannelProvider
// per storage partition, to which all connections from renderers in that
// partition are bound. This instance will then forward messages received on a
// particular connection to all other connections in the same storage partition
// with the same origin and name.
