# App different than the regular content subcomponents (see comments in
# //content/BUILD.gn) because it has to support the browser/child process split
# (the "both" target include both browser and child process files and is used
# for testing).
#
# In non-component mode, browser, child, and both all follow the same structure:
# foo ->
#   //content/public/app:child (group) ->
#     //content/public/app:child_sources (source set) ->
#       //content/app:child (source set)

# In component mode, content is linked as one big turd so there is only one
# app target containing sources ("both") and the other ones forward to it:
# foo ->
#   //content/public/app:child (group; "browser" and "both" ones look the same)
#     //content (shared library) ->
#       //content/public/app:app_sources (source set)
