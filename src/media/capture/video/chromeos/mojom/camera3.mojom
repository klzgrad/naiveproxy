// Camera3DeviceOps is mostly a translation of the camera3_device_ops_t API from
// Android camera HAL v3.  This is the interface to interact with a camera
// device in the camera HAL.
//
// The work flow of the Camera3DeviceOps is:
//
//   1. Call Initialize() to register the Camera3CallbackOps interface with the
//      camera HAL.
//
//   2. Call ConfigureStreams() to negotiate the set of usable video streams
//      with the camera HAL.
//
//   3. After the video streams are successfully configured, call
//      ConstructDefaultRequestSettings() to get the capture settings for each
//      stream.  The capture settings of a stream will be associated with the
//      capture requests of the stream.
//
//   4. Start the capture loop. The capture loop is composed of a series of
//      capture requests and results.
//
//      The capture loop shall call ProcessCaptureRequest() to request capturing
//      each frame.  A request may contain multiple streams and the camera HAL
//      would fill the buffers of each streams per requirements specified in
//      ConfigureStreams().  For example, the camera HAL may fill a frame to a
//      still capture buffer with the native capture resolution, and down-scale
//      the same frame to a lower resolution for the preview buffer.
//
//      The client may continue calling ProcessCaptureRequest() up to the
//      pipe-line depth configured in ConfigureStreams().
//
//      When the camera HAL is done with a capture request, the capture result
//      is sent back to the client through the callbacks in Camera3CallbackOps.
//
//      For each capture result:
//        a. The camera HAL notifies the client through Notify() of the shutter
//           time of the captured frame.  If an error happens while capturing a
//           frame or filling a buffer, the camera HAL notifies the client
//           through Notify() of the error.
//        b. The camera HAL returns the capture result with various result
//           metadata and the filled buffers to the client in
//           ProcessCaptureResult().  The result metadata may be sent partially
//           in multiple stages, and the client must wait until all the partial
//           metadata are received before handing the capture result to upper
//           layer.
//
//    5. Dump() can be used to dump various information of the camera HAL for
//       debug purpose.
//
//    6. Flush() tells the camera HAL to finish processing or discard the
//       current on-going capture requests and return to the state where
//       ConfigureStreams() can be called again to set up new streams.
//
//    7. Close() closes the camera device.
//
