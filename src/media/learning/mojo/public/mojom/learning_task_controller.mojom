// Client for a single learning task.  Intended to be the primary API for client
// code that generates FeatureVectors / requests predictions for a single task.
// The API supports sending in an observed FeatureVector without a target value,
// so that framework-provided features (FeatureProvider) can be snapshotted at
// the right time.  One doesn't generally want to wait until the TargetValue is
// observed to do that.
//
// Typically, this interface will allow non-browser processes to communicate
// with the learning framework in the browser.
interface LearningTaskController {
  // Start a new observation.  Call this at the time one would try to predict
  // the TargetValue.  This lets the framework snapshot any framework-provided
  // feature values at prediction time.  Later, if you want to turn these
  // features into an example for training a model, then call
  // CompleteObservation with the same id and an ObservationCompletion.
  // Otherwise, call CancelObservation with |id|.  It's also okay to destroy the
  // controller with outstanding observations; these will be cancelled if no
  // |default_target| was specified, else they will be completed using that as
  // the target value.
  BeginObservation(mojo_base.mojom.UnguessableToken id,

          ObservationCompletion completion);

  // Cancel observation |id|.  Deleting |this| will do the same.
  CancelObservation(mojo_base.mojom.UnguessableToken id);

  // Update the default target for |id| to |default_target|.  May also unset it,
  // so that the observation will be cancelled if the controller is destroyed.
