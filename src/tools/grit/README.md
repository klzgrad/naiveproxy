## History

This code previously used to live at
https://code.google.com/p/grit-i18n/source/checkout which still contains the
project's history.  https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/grit-i18n/ is
a git mirror of the SVN repository that's identical except for the last two
commits.  The project is now developed in the Chromium project directly.

There is a read-only mirror of just this directory at
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/tools/grit/ if you don't want to
check out all of Chromium.
