<h4>Privacy and Google Desktop Search</h4>

<p><FONT SIZE=-1>Google is committed to making search on your desktop as easy
as searching the web.  We recognize that privacy is an important issue,
so we designed and built Google Desktop Search with respect for your privacy.
<p>
So that you can easily search your computer, the Google Desktop Search application indexes
and stores versions of your files and other computer activity, 
such as email, chats, and web history.  These versions may also be mixed 
with your Web search results to produce 
results pages for you that integrate relevant content from your computer and 
information from the Web. 
<p>
Your computer's content is not made accessible to Google or anyone else without your explicit permission. 

<p>You can read the 
<A HREF='http://desktop.google.com/privacypolicy.html?hl=[LANG_CODE]'>Privacy Policy</A>
and <A HREF='http://desktop.google.com/privacyfaq.html?hl=[LANG_CODE]'>Privacy FAQ</A> online.
