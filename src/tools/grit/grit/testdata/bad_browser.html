</font></ul> 

<p><font size="-1">You may <a href="[REDIR]">click here</a> to use your 
	unsupported browser, though you likely will encounter some areas that don't 
	work as expected. You need to have Javascript enabled, regardless of the 
	browser you use.</font>
<p><font size="-1">We hope to expand this list in the near future and announce new 
	browsers as they become available.
