# The first entry in the file, SRCDIR, is special: It is a relative path from
# this file to the base of your checkout.
#
# http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t2zechd4(VS.71).aspx says that the
# range for IDR_ is 1 to 28,671 and the range for IDS_ is 1 to 32,767 and
# common convention starts practical use of IDs at 100 or 101.
