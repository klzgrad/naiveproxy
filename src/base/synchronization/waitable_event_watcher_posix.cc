// The basic design is that we add an AsyncWaiter to the wait-list of the event.
// That AsyncWaiter has a pointer to SequencedTaskRunner, and a Task to be
// posted to it. The task ends up calling the callback when it runs on the
// sequence.
//
// Since the wait can be canceled, we have a thread-safe Flag object which is
// set when the wait has been canceled. At each stage in the above, we check the
// flag before going onto the next stage. Since the wait may only be canceled in
// the sequence which runs the Task, we are assured that the callback cannot be
// called after canceling...
