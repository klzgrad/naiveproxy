# Changes to code that runs at high privilege and which has a high risk of
# memory corruption, such as parsers for complex inputs, require a security
# review to avoid introducing sandbox escapes.

# Although this file is in base/, it may apply to more than just base, OWNERS
# files outside of base may also include this file.

# Security team: If you are uncomfortable reviewing a particular bit of code

# Nobody knows everything, and the only way to learn is from experience.
