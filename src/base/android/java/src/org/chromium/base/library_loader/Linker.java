/*
 * Technical note:
 *
 * The point of this class is to provide an alternative to System.loadLibrary()
 * to load the native shared library. One specific feature that it supports is the
 * ability to save RAM by sharing the ELF RELRO sections between renderer
 * processes.
 *
 * When two processes load the same native library at the _same_ memory address,
 * the content of their RELRO section (which includes C++ vtables or any
 * constants that contain pointers) will be largely identical [1].
 *
 * By default, the RELRO section is backed by private RAM in each process, which is still
 * significant on mobile (e.g. ~2 MB / process on Chrome 77 ARM, more on ARM64).
 *
 * However, it is possible to save RAM by creating a shared memory region,
 * copy the RELRO content into it, then have each process swap its private,
 * regular RELRO, with a shared, read-only, mapping of the shared one.
 *
 * This trick saves 98% of the RELRO section size per extra process, after the
 * first one. On the other hand, this requires careful communication between
 * the process where the shared RELRO is created and the one(s) where it is used.
 *
 * LegacyLinker only:
 * Note that swapping the regular RELRO with the shared one is not an atomic
 * operation. Care must be taken that no other thread tries to run native code
 * that accesses it during it. In practice, this means the swap must happen
 * before library native code is executed.
 *
 * [1] The exceptions are pointers to external, randomized, symbols, like
 * those from some system libraries, but these are very few in practice.
 */

/*
 * Security considerations:
 *
 * - The shared RELRO memory region is always forced read-only after creation,
 *   which means it is impossible for a compromised service process to map
 *   it read-write (e.g. by calling mmap() or mprotect()) and modify its
 *   content, altering values seen in other service processes.
 *
 * - Once the RELRO ashmem region or file is mapped into a service process's
 *   address space, the corresponding file descriptor is immediately closed. The
 *   file descriptor is kept opened in the browser process, because a copy needs
 *   to be sent to each new potential service process.
 *
 * - The common library load addresses are randomized for each instance of
 *   the program on the device. See getRandomBaseLoadAddress() for more
 *   details on how this is obtained.
 */

/**
 * Here's an explanation of how this class is supposed to be used:
 *
 *  - The native shared library must be loaded with Linker.loadLibrary(),
 *    instead of System.loadLibrary(). The two functions should behave the same
 *    (at a high level).
 *
 *  - Before loading the library, setApkFilePath() must be called when loading from the APK.
 *
 *  - A service process shall call either initServiceProcess() or
 *    disableSharedRelros() early (i.e. before loadLibrary() is called).
 *    Otherwise, the linker considers that it is running inside the browser
 *    process. This is because various Chromium projects have vastly
 *    different initialization paths.
 *
 *    disableSharedRelros() completely disables shared RELRO, and loadLibrary()
 *    will behave exactly like System.loadLibrary().
 *
 *    initServiceProcess(baseLoadAddress) indicates that shared RELRO are to be
 *    used in this process.
 *
 *  - The browser is in charge of deciding where in memory each library should
 *    be loaded. This address must be passed to each service process (see
 *    ChromiumLinkerParams.java in //content for a helper class to do so).
 *
 *  - The browser will also generate shared RELRO for the loaded library.
 *
 *  - Once the library has been loaded in the browser process, one can call getSharedRelros() which
 *    returns a Bundle instance containing the shared RELRO region.
 *
 *    This Bundle must be passed to each service process, for example through
 *    a Binder call (note that the Bundle includes file descriptors and cannot
 *    be added as an Intent extra).
 *
 *  - In a service process, loadLibrary() may block until the RELRO section Bundle is received. This
 *    is typically done by calling provideSharedRelros() from another thread.
 *
 *    This method also ensures the process uses the shared RELROs.
