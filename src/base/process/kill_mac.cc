// Waits for |timeout| seconds for the given |child| to exit and reap it. If
// the child doesn't exit within the time specified, kills it.
//
// This function takes two approaches: first, it tries to use kqueue to
// observe when the process exits. kevent can monitor a kqueue with a
// timeout, so this method is preferred to wait for a specified period of
// time. Once the kqueue indicates the process has exited, waitpid will reap
// the exited child. If the kqueue doesn't provide an exit event notification,
// before the timeout expires, or if the kqueue fails or misbehaves, the
// process will be mercilessly killed and reaped.
//
// A child process passed to this function may be in one of several states:
// running, terminated and not yet reaped, and (apparently, and unfortunately)
// terminated and already reaped. Normally, a process will at least have been
// asked to exit before this function is called, but this is not required.
// If a process is terminating and unreaped, there may be a window between the
// time that kqueue will no longer recognize it and when it becomes an actual
// zombie that a non-blocking (WNOHANG) waitpid can reap. This condition is
// detected when kqueue indicates that the process is not running and a
// non-blocking waitpid fails to reap the process but indicates that it is
// still running. In this event, a blocking attempt to reap the process
// collects the known-dying child, preventing zombies from congregating.
//
// In the event that the kqueue misbehaves entirely, as it might under a
// EMFILE condition ("too many open files", or out of file descriptors), this
// function will forcibly kill and reap the child without delay. This
// eliminates another potential zombie vector. (If you're out of file
// descriptors, you're probably deep into something else, but that doesn't
// mean that zombies be allowed to kick you while you're down.)
//
// The fact that this function seemingly can be called to wait on a child
// that's not only already terminated but already reaped is a bit of a
// problem: a reaped child's pid can be reclaimed and may refer to a distinct
// process in that case. The fact that this function can seemingly be called
// to wait on a process that's not even a child is also a problem: kqueue will
// work in that case, but waitpid won't, and killing a non-child might not be
// the best approach.
