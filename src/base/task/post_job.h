// Returns a JobHandle associated with the Job, which can be joined, canceled or
// detached.
// ThreadPool APIs, including PostJob() and methods of the returned JobHandle,
// must never be called while holding a lock that could be acquired by
// |worker_task| or |max_concurrency_callback| -- that could result in a
// deadlock. This is because [1] |max_concurrency_callback| may be invoked while
// holding internal ThreadPool lock (A), hence |max_concurrency_callback| can
// only use a lock (B) if that lock is *never* held while calling back into a
// ThreadPool entry point from any thread (A=>B/B=>A deadlock) and [2]
// |worker_task| or |max_concurrency_callback| is invoked synchronously from
// JobHandle::Join() (A=>JobHandle::Join()=>A deadlock).
// To avoid scheduling overhead, |worker_task| should do as much work as
// possible in a loop when invoked, and JobDelegate::ShouldYield() should be
// periodically invoked to conditionally exit and let the scheduler prioritize
// work.
//
// A canonical implementation of |worker_task| looks like:
//   void WorkerTask(JobDelegate* job_delegate) {
//     while (!job_delegate->ShouldYield()) {
//       auto work_item = worker_queue.TakeWorkItem(); // Smallest unit of work.
//       if (!work_item)
//         return:
//       ProcessWork(work_item);
//     }
//   }
//
// |max_concurrency_callback| controls the maximum number of threads calling
// |worker_task| concurrently. |worker_task| is only invoked if the number of
// threads previously running |worker_task| was less than the value returned by
// |max_concurrency_callback|. In general, |max_concurrency_callback| should
// return the latest number of incomplete work items (smallest unit of work)
// left to processed. JobHandle/JobDelegate::NotifyConcurrencyIncrease() *must*
// be invoked shortly after |max_concurrency_callback| starts returning a value
// larger than previously returned values. This usually happens when new work
// items are added and the API user wants additional threads to invoke
// |worker_task| concurrently. The callbacks may be called concurrently on any
// thread until the job is complete. If the job handle is detached, the
// callbacks may still be called, so they must not access global state that
// could be destroyed.
//
// |traits| requirements:
// - base::ThreadPolicy must be specified if the priority of the task runner
//   will ever be increased from BEST_EFFORT.
