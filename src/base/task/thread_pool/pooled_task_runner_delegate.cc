// threads have been joined. This makes the variable const while worker threads
// are up and as such it doesn't need to be atomic.
// Also used to tell if an attempt is made to run a task after its
// task runner's delegate is no longer the current delegate, i.e., a task runner
// is created in one unit test and posted to in a subsequent test, due to global
// state leaking between tests.
