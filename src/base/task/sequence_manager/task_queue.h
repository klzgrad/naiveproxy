// A `TaskQueue` represents an ordered list of tasks sharing common properties,
// e.g. priority, throttling, etc. `TaskQueue`s are associated with a
// `SequenceManager` instance, which chooses the next task from its set of
// queues. `TaskQueue`s should typically be used on a single thread since most
// methods are not thread safe (enforeced via CHECKs), but cross-thread task
// posting is supported with thread-safe task runners.
//
// A `TaskQueue` is unregistered (stops accepting and running tasks) when either
// its associated `TaskQueue::Handle` or `SequenceManager` is destroyed. If the
// handle is destroyed while the `SequenceManager` is still alive, the
// `SequenceManager` takes ownership of the queue and schedules it for deletion
// after the current task finishes. Otherwise, if the handle outlives the
// sequence manager, the queue is destroyed when the handle is destroyed.
