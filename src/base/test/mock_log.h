// A MockLog object intercepts LOG() messages issued during its lifespan.  Using
// this together with gMock, it's very easy to test how a piece of code calls
// LOG().  The typical usage:
//
//   TEST(FooTest, LogsCorrectly) {
//     MockLog log;
//
//     // We expect the WARNING "Something bad!" exactly twice.
//     EXPECT_CALL(log, Log(WARNING, _, "Something bad!"))
//         .Times(2);
//
//     // We allow foo.cc to call LOG(INFO) any number of times.
//     EXPECT_CALL(log, Log(INFO, HasSubstr("/foo.cc"), _))
//         .Times(AnyNumber());
//
//     log.StartCapturingLogs();  // Call this after done setting expectations.
//     Foo();  // Exercises the code under test.
//   }
//
// CAVEAT: base/logging does not allow a thread to call LOG() again when it's
// already inside a LOG() call.  Doing so will cause a deadlock.  Therefore,
// it's the user's responsibility to not call LOG() in an action triggered by
// MockLog::Log().  You may call RAW_LOG() instead.
