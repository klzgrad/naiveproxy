// This header exposes SingleThreadTaskEnvironment and TaskEnvironment.
//
// SingleThreadTaskEnvironment enables the following APIs within its scope:
//  - (SingleThread|Sequenced)TaskRunner::CurrentDefaultHandle on the main
//    thread
//  - RunLoop on the main thread
//
// TaskEnvironment additionally enables:
//  - posting to base::ThreadPool through base/task/thread_pool.h.
//
// Hint: For content::BrowserThreads, use content::BrowserTaskEnvironment.
//
// Tests should prefer SingleThreadTaskEnvironment over TaskEnvironment when the
// former is sufficient.
//
// Tasks posted to the (SingleThread|Sequenced)TaskRunner::CurrentDefaultHandle
// run synchronously when RunLoop::Run(UntilIdle) or
// TaskEnvironment::RunUntil(Idle|Quit) is called on the main thread.
//
// The TaskEnvironment requires TestTimeouts::Initialize() to be called in order
// to run posted tasks, so that it can watch for problematic long-running tasks.
//
// The TimeSource trait can be used to request that delayed tasks be under the
// manual control of RunLoop::Run() and TaskEnvironment::FastForward*() methods.
//
// If a TaskEnvironment's ThreadPoolExecutionMode is QUEUED, ThreadPool tasks
// run when RunUntilIdle(), RunUntilQuit(), or ~TaskEnvironment is called. If
// ThreadPoolExecutionMode is ASYNC, they run as they are posted.
//
// All TaskEnvironment methods must be called from the main thread.
//
// Usage:
//
//   class MyTestFixture : public testing::Test {
//    public:
//     (...)
//
//    // protected rather than private visibility will allow controlling the
//    // task environment (e.g. RunUntilIdle(), FastForwardBy(), etc.). from the
//    // test body.
//    protected:
//     // Must generally be the first member to be initialized first and
//     // destroyed last (some members that require single-threaded
//     // initialization and tear down may need to come before -- e.g.
//     // base::test::ScopedFeatureList). Extra traits, like TimeSource, are
//     // best provided inline when declaring the TaskEnvironment, as
//     // such:
//     base::test::TaskEnvironment task_environment_{
