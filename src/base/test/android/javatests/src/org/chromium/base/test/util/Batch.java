/**
 * Annotation to indicate that this collection of tests is safe to run in batches, where the
 * Instrumentation Runner (and hence the process) does not need to be restarted between these tests.
 *
 * The value passed to this annotation determines which test suites may be run together in the same
 * batch - batches that share a batch name will run in the same Instrumentation invocation. The
 * default value (empty) means the suite runs as its own batch, and the process is restarted before
 * and after the suite.
 *
 * This makes the tests run significantly faster, but you must be careful not to persist changes to
 * global state that could cause other tests in the batch to fail.
 *
 * @Before/@After will run as expected before/after each test method.
 * @BeforeClass/@AfterClass may be used for one-time initialization across all tests within a single
 * suite. Tests wishing to share one-time initialization across suites in the same batch will need
 * to explicitly coordinate.
