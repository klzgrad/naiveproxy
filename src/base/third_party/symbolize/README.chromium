The following files were copied from:
https://github.com/google/glog/tree/b70ea80433c2a8f20b832be97b90f1f82b0d29e9

- glog/logging.h
- glog/raw_logging.h
- demangle.cc
- demangle.h
- symbolize.cc
- symbolize.h
- utilities.h

config.h is auto-generated using the glog build and then trimmed down to only
the macros used in the files above.

Local modifications:
- 001-fix-up-includes.patch: remove includes for "base/mutex.h" and change
  logging headers to be included as user headers rather than system headers.
- 002-minimal-logging.patch: remove everything except a RAW_LOG() macro that
  does nothing.
- 003-minimal-utilities.patch: remove everything except a macro for wrapping
  the noninline compiler attribute.
- 004-add-missing-symbolize-header.patch: add an include for symbolize.h to
  symbolize.cc. This patch should be upstreamed.
- 005-expose-file-helpers.patch: expose helpers for working with symbol files.
- 006-use-sandbox-hook-for-open-object-file.patch: use the sandbox hook for
  the exposed helper for opening object files. This patch should be upstreamed.
- 007-sys-types-h.patch: include <sys/types.h> to get ssize_t on non-glibc
  platforms.
- 008-include-cstdlib.patch: include <cstdlib> for abort() rather than relying
  on transitive includes.
- 009-clone-absl-demangle.patch: Clone the demangling implementation from
  abseil-cpp, which is itself a fork of https://github.com/google/glog/.
- 010-clang-format.patch: format the source files using Chrome formatting rules.
