Description:
This is a fast non-cryptographic hash function.

There are currently two distinct sets of CityHash functions:
v1.0.3 and v1.1+ that produce distinct outputs.

The version in //base/third_party/cityhash_v103 is 1.0.3 and has some hash
quality issues that led to non-backwards compatible changes in v1.1+. See
//base/hash/README.md for instructions on how to choose a hash function.

Local changes:
- guarded function declaration (i.e. CityHash64) within a namespace
(base::internal::cityhash_v111).
- defined bswap_32/bswap_64 to use compiler builtins to make 'native_client'
build pass.
- remove unneeded CRC32 stuff.
- formating to make 'git cl format' happy.
- Use the builtins for bswap when compiling with clang.
