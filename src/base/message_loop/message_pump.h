  //
  // Notice that the run loop cycles between calling DoNativeWork and DoWork
  // methods. This helps ensure that none of these work queues starve the
  // others. This is important for message pumps that are used to drive
  // animations, for example.
  //
  // Notice also that after each callout to foreign code, the run loop checks to
  // see if it should quit.  The Quit method is responsible for setting this
  // flag.  No further work is done once the quit flag is set.
  //
  // NOTE 1: Run may be called reentrantly from any of the callouts to foreign
  // code (internal work, DoWork, DoIdleWork). As a result, DoWork and
  // DoIdleWork must be reentrant.
  //
  // NOTE 2: Run implementations must arrange for DoWork to be invoked as
  // expected if a callout to foreign code enters a message pump outside their
  // control. For example, the MessageBox API on Windows pumps UI messages. If
  // the MessageBox API is called (indirectly) from within Run, it is expected
  // that DoWork will be invoked from within that call in response to
  // ScheduleWork or as requested by the last NextWorkInfo returned by DoWork.
  // The MessagePump::Delegate may then elect to do nested work or not depending
