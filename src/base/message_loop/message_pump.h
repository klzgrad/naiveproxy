  //   This type of pump is backed by a NSRunLoop. This is only for use on
  //   OSX and IOS.

  // The Run method is called to enter the message pump's run loop.

  // message pump should take care to mix delegate callbacks with native
  // message processing so neither type of event starves the other of cycles.
  //
  // The anatomy of a typical run loop:
  //
  //   for (;;) {
  //     bool did_work = DoInternalWork();
  //     if (should_quit_)
  //       break;

  //     if (did_work)
  //       continue;
  //
  //     WaitForWork();
  //   }
  //
  // Here, DoInternalWork is some private method of the message pump that is
  // responsible for dispatching the next UI message or notifying the next IO
  // completion (for example).  WaitForWork is a private method that simply
  // blocks until there is more work of any type to do.
  //
  // Notice that the run loop cycles between calling DoInternalWork, DoWork,
  // and DoDelayedWork methods.  This helps ensure that none of these work
  // queues starve the others.  This is important for message pumps that are
  // used to drive animations, for example.
  //
  // Notice also that after each callout to foreign code, the run loop checks
  // to see if it should quit.  The Quit method is responsible for setting this
  // flag.  No further work is done once the quit flag is set.
  //
  // NOTE: Care must be taken to handle Run being called again from within any
  // of the callouts to foreign code.  Native message pumps may also need to
  // deal with other native message pumps being run outside their control
  // (e.g., the MessageBox API on Windows pumps UI messages!).  To be specific,
  // the callouts (DoWork and DoDelayedWork) MUST still be provided even in
  // nested sub-loops that are "seemingly" outside the control of this message
  // pump.  DoWork in particular must never be starved for time slices unless
  // it returns false (meaning it has run out of things to do).
