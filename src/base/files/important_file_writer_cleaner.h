// A cleaner for forgotten .tmp files left behind by ImportantFileWriter; see
// https://crbug.com/1075917.
//
// ImportantFileWriter has the potential to leak .tmp files in case of a crash
// or power failure during processing, or in case of interference by third-party
// software. This class implements a singleton that makes a single scan over
// given directories to delete any *.tmp files older than the current process.
// Processes that use ImportantFileWriter are expected to call the instance's
// Start method at some point during startup to enable the cleaner.
// ImportantFileWriter calls the AddDirectory method to provide the directory
// hosting an "important" file. Hosting processes are expected to call the Stop
// method at shutdown so that metrics of an in-process execution can be
// recorded.
//
// The deletion scan takes place in a background task. Metrics are recorded when
// a directory is fully processed, or shortly after the hosting process calls
// the Stop method.
