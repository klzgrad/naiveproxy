// is corrupted by *system* crash, though even if the ImportantFileWriter call
// has already returned at the time of the crash it is not specified which
// version of the file (old or new) is preserved. And depending on system
// configuration (hardware and software) a significant likelihood of file
// corruption may remain, thus using ImportantFileWriter is not a valid
// substitute for file integrity checks and recovery codepaths for malformed
// files.

// for details) and thus please don't block shutdown on ImportantFileWriter.
