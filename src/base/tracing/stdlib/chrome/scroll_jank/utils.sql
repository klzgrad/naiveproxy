INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE chrome.event_latency;

-- This function takes timestamps of two consecutive frames and determines if
-- its janky by a delay of more than 0.5 of a frame  in order to make sure that
-- the comparison does not filter out ratios that are precisely 0.5, which can
-- fall a little above or below exact value due to inherent inaccuracy of operations with
-- floating-point numbers. Value 1e-9 have been chosen as follows: the ratio has
-- nanoseconds in numerator and VSync interval in denominator. Assuming refresh
-- rate more than 1 FPS (and therefore VSync interval less than a second), this
-- ratio should increase with increments more than minimal value in numerator
-- (1ns) divided by maximum value in denominator, giving 1e-9.

-- Function : function takes scroll ids of frames to verify it's from
-- the same scroll, and makes sure the frame ts occurred within the scroll
-- timestamp of the neighbour and computes whether the frame was janky or not.
