-- This file implements the scrolling predictor jank metric, as is
-- implemented in cc/metrics/predictor_jank_tracker.cc. See comments in that
-- file to get additional context on how the metric is implemented.
--
-- "Delta" here refers to how much (in pixels) the page offset changed for a
-- given frame due to a scroll.
