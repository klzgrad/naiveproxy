// `set.find(kFoo)` is ill-formed, since there is no implimit conversion from
// std::string_view to `std::string`. This means Contains would fall back to the
// general purpose `std::ranges::find(set, kFoo)` linear search.
// To fix this clients can either use a more generic comparator like std::less<>
// (in this case `set.find()` accepts any type that is comparable to a
// std::string), or pass an explicit projection parameter to Contains, at which
// point it will always perform a linear search.
