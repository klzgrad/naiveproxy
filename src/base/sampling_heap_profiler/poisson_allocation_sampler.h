  // kIsRunning, thread B calls RecordAlloc, and thread C calls RecordFree.
  // (Something else could update `profiling_state_` to remove kIsRunning before
  // RecordAlloc or RecordFree.)
  //
  // 1. If RecordAlloc(p) sees !kWasStarted or !kIsRunning it will return
  //    immediately, so p won't be in sampled_address_set(). So no matter what
  //    RecordFree(p) sees it will also return immediately.
  //
  // 2. If RecordFree() is called with a pointer that was never passed to
  //    RecordAlloc(), again it will return immediately no matter what it sees.
  //
  // 3. If RecordAlloc(p) sees kIsRunning it will put p in
  //    sampled_address_set(). In this case RecordFree(p) MUST see !kWasStarted
  //    or it will return without removing p:
  //
  //    3a. If the program got p as the return value from malloc() and passed it
  //        to free(), then RecordFree() happens-after RecordAlloc() and
  //        therefore will see the same value of `profiling_state_` as
  //        RecordAlloc() for all memory orders. (Proof: using the definitions
  //        of sequenced-after, happens-after and inter-thread happens-after
  //        from https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order, malloc()
  //        calls RecordAlloc() so its return is sequenced-after RecordAlloc();
  //        free() inter-thread happens-after malloc's return because it
  //        consumes the result; RecordFree() is sequenced-after its caller,
  //        free(); therefore RecordFree() interthread happens-after
  //        RecordAlloc().)
  //    3b. If the program is freeing a random pointer which coincidentally was
  //        also returned from malloc(), such that free(p) does not happen-after
  //        malloc(), then there is already an unavoidable race condition. If
  //        the profiler sees malloc() before free(p), then it will add p to
  //        sampled_addresses_set() and then remove it; otherwise it will do
  //        nothing in RecordFree() and add p to sampled_addresses_set() in
  //        RecordAlloc(), recording a potential leak. Reading
  //        `profiling_state_` with relaxed ordering adds another possibility:
  //        if the profiler sees malloc() with kWasStarted and then free without
  //        kWasStarted, it will add p to sampled_addresses_set() in
  //        RecordAlloc() and then do nothing in RecordFree(). This has the same
  //        outcome as the existing race.
