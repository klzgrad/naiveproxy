// A "timer" takes care of invoking a callback in the future, once or
// repeatedly. The callback is invoked:
// - OneShotTimer: Once after a `TimeDelta` delay has elapsed.
// - RetainingOneShotTimer: Same as OneShotTimer, but the callback is retained
//    after being executed, allowing another invocation to be scheduled with
//    Reset() without specifying the callback again.
// - DeadlineTimer: Once at the specified `TimeTicks` time.
// - RepeatingTimer: Repeatedly, with a specified `TimeDelta` delay before the
//    first invocation and between invocations.
// - MetronomeTimer: Repeatedly, with a specified `TimeDelta` delay between the
//    beginning of each invocations such that a constant phase is respected.
// (Retaining)OneShotTimer and RepeatingTimer automatically apply some leeway to
// the delay whereas DeadlineTimer and MetronomeTimer allow more control over
// the requested time. As a result, the former are generally more
// power-efficient.
// Prefer using (Retaining)OneShotTimer and RepeatingTimer because they
// automatically apply some leeway to the delay which enables power-efficient
// scheduling.

// Scheduled invocations can be cancelled with Stop() or by deleting the
// Timer. The latter makes it easy to ensure that an object is not accessed by a
// Timer after it has been deleted: just make the Timer a member of the object
// which receives Timer events (see example below).
//
// Sample RepeatingTimer usage:
//
//   class MyClass {
//    public:
//     void StartDoingStuff() {
//       timer_.Start(FROM_HERE, base::Seconds(1),
//                    this, &MyClass::DoStuff);
//       // Alternative form if the callback is not bound to `this` or
//       // requires arguments:
//       //    timer_.Start(FROM_HERE, base::Seconds(1),
//       //                 base::BindRepeating(&MyFunction, 42));
//     }
//     void StopDoingStuff() {
//       timer_.Stop();
//     }
//    private:
//     void DoStuff() {
//       // This method is called every second to do stuff.
//       ...
//     }
//     base::RepeatingTimer timer_;
//   };
//
// These APIs are not thread safe. When a method is called (except the
// constructor), all further method calls must be on the same sequence until
// Stop(). Once stopped, it may be destroyed or restarted on another sequence.
//
// By default, the scheduled tasks will be run on the same sequence that the
// Timer was *started on*. To mock time in unit tests, some old tests used
// SetTaskRunner() to schedule the delay on a test-controlled TaskRunner. The
// modern and preferred approach to mock time is to use TaskEnvironment's
// MOCK_TIME mode.
