// A class that provides a means to asynchronously wait for a Windows object to
// become signaled.  It is an abstraction around RegisterWaitForSingleObject
// that provides a notification callback, OnObjectSignaled, that runs back on
// the origin sequence (i.e., the sequence that called StartWatching).
//
// This class acts like a smart pointer such that when it goes out-of-scope,
// UnregisterWaitEx is automatically called, and any in-flight notification is
// suppressed.
//
// The waiting handle MUST NOT be closed while watching is in progress. If this
// handle is closed while the wait is still pending, the behavior is undefined
// (see MSDN:RegisterWaitForSingleObject).
//
// Typical usage:
//
//   class MyClass : public base::win::ObjectWatcher::Delegate {
//    public:
//     void DoStuffWhenSignaled(HANDLE object) {
//       watcher_.StartWatchingOnce(object, this);
//     }
//     void OnObjectSignaled(HANDLE object) override {
//       // OK, time to do stuff!
//     }
//    private:
//     base::win::ObjectWatcher watcher_;
//   };
//
// In the above example, MyClass wants to "do stuff" when object becomes
// signaled.  ObjectWatcher makes this task easy.  When MyClass goes out of
// scope, the watcher_ will be destroyed, and there is no need to worry about
// OnObjectSignaled being called on a deleted MyClass pointer.  Easy!
// If the object is already signaled before being watched, OnObjectSignaled is
// still called after (but not necessarily immediately after) watch is started.
//
// NOTE: Except for the constructor, all public methods of this class must be
// called in sequence, in a scope where SequencedTaskRunnerHandle::IsSet().
