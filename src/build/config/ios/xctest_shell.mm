// For Chrome on iOS we want to run EarlGrey tests (that are XCTests) for all
// our build configurations (Debug, Release, ...). In addition, the symbols
// visibility is configured to private by default. To simplify testing with
// those constraints, our tests are compiled in the TEST_HOST target instead
// of the .xctest bundle that all link against this single test (just there to
// ensure that the bundle is not empty).
