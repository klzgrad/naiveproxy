#
# Warnings that prevent narrowing or comparisons of integer types that are
# likely to cause out-of-bound read/writes or Undefined Behaviour. In
# particular, size_t is used for memory sizes, allocation, indexing, and
# offsets. Using other integer types along with size_t produces risk of
# memory-safety bugs and thus security exploits.
#
# In order to prevent these bugs, allocation sizes were historically limited to
# sizes that can be represented within 31 bits of information, allowing `int` to
# be safely misused instead of `size_t` (https://crbug.com/169327). In order to
# support increasing the allocation limit we require strictly adherence to
# using the correct types, avoiding lossy conversions, and preventing overflow.
# To do so, enable this config and fix errors by converting types to be
# `size_t`, which is both large enough and unsigned, when dealing with memory
# sizes, allocations, indices, or offsets.In cases where type conversion is not
# possible or is superfluous, use base::strict_cast<> or base::checked_cast<>
# to convert to size_t as needed.
