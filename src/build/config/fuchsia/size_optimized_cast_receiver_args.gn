# This file contains feature and optimization overrides that are commonly

# It prioritizes size and disables unneeded features that may add size.
#
# To use it do one of the following:
# * Add the following to your `gn args`:
#   import("//build/config/fuchsia/size_optimized_cast_receiver_args.gn")
# * Add the following to `gn_args` in a bot recipe:
#   'args_file': '//build/config/fuchsia/size_optimized_cast_receiver_args.gn'

# There is no reason these values couldn't be used on other platforms, but this
# file is in a fuchsia/ directory and some refactoring would probably be
# appropriate before reusing this file.
# It is not possible to assert the platform because `target_os` is not defined
# when this file is imported.
