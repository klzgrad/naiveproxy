# This file is used to suppress warnings based on the file they originate from,
# as opposed to disabling warnings via -Wno flags which apply to all the files

# Warning Suppression Policy: updates to this file should be tightly controlled,
# for reasons discussed in crbug.com/404297941. In particular:
#
# 1. This file should never grow (as measured by the number of files suppressed)
#    except when a new warning is enabled.
# 2. This file should only be used to opt out whole directories, never
#    individual files.
# 3. This file should be used as a last resort; if it's possible to fix the warning or suppress
#    it without using the file, do so.
#    1. For first-party code, just fix it directly, or use `#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored`.
#    2. For third-party code, first attempt to fix it upstream.
#    3. If that's not possible, attempt to suppress the warning using `-Wno` flags in a gn file.
# 4. All entries should have a path to eventually be removed.
#
# In practice, rules (3) and (4) mean that the only accepted use case for this file is to
# speed up rolls or enable a warning slightly sooner, for cases where an upstream fix has been
# proposed but is likely to take a long time to get merged and rolled into chromium.
#
# We may make an exception to the policy for extremely high-value warnings that backslide a lot
# (such as unsafe buffers), but this is expected to be rare.

# Formatting note: Don't put comments on the same line as a glob pattern! Clang
# will get confused and the warning won't be suppressed.
