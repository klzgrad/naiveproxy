"""Writes a build_config file.

The build_config file for a target is a json file containing information about
how to build that target based on the target's dependencies. This includes
things like: the javac classpath, the list of android resources dependencies,
etc. It also includes the information needed to create the build_config for
other targets that depend on that one.

Android build scripts should not refer to the build_config directly, and the
build specification should instead pass information in using the special
file-arg syntax (see build_utils.py:ExpandFileArgs). That syntax allows passing
of values in a json dict in a file and looks like this:
  --python-arg=@FileArg(build_config_path:javac:classpath)

Note: If paths to input files are passed in this way, it is important that:
  1. inputs/deps of the action ensure that the files are available the first
  time the action runs.
  2. Either (a) or (b)
    a. inputs/deps ensure that the action runs whenever one of the files changes
    b. the files are added to the action's depfile

NOTE: All paths within .build_config files are relative to $OUTPUT_CHROMIUM_DIR.

This is a technical note describing the format of .build_config files.
Please keep it updated when changing this script. For extraction and
visualization instructions, see build/android/docs/build_config.md

------------- BEGIN_MARKDOWN ---------------------------------------------------
The .build_config file format
===

# Introduction

This document tries to explain the format of `.build_config` generated during
the Android build of Chromium. For a higher-level explanation of these files,
please read
[build/android/docs/build_config.md](build/android/docs/build_config.md).

# The `deps_info` top-level dictionary:

All `.build_config` files have a required `'deps_info'` key, whose value is a
dictionary describing the target and its dependencies. The latter has the
following required keys:

## Required keys in `deps_info`:

* `deps_info['type']`: The target type as a string.

    The following types are known by the internal GN build rules and the
    build scripts altogether:

    * [java_binary](#target_java_binary)
    * [java_annotation_processor](#target_java_annotation_processor)
    * [junit_binary](#target_junit_binary)
    * [java_library](#target_java_library)
    * [android_assets](#target_android_assets)
    * [android_resources](#target_android_resources)
    * [android_apk](#target_android_apk)
    * [android_app_bundle_module](#target_android_app_bundle_module)
    * [android_app_bundle](#target_android_app_bundle)
    * [dist_jar](#target_dist_jar)
    * [dist_aar](#target_dist_aar)
    * [resource_rewriter](#target_resource_rewriter)
    * [group](#target_group)

    See later sections for more details of some of these.

* `deps_info['path']`: Path to the target's `.build_config` file.

* `deps_info['name']`: Nothing more than the basename of `deps_info['path']`
at the moment.

* `deps_info['deps_configs']`: List of paths to the `.build_config` files of
all *direct* dependencies of the current target.

    NOTE: Because the `.build_config` of a given target is always generated
    after the `.build_config` of its dependencies, the `write_build_config.py`
    script can use chains of `deps_configs` to compute transitive dependencies
    for each target when needed.

## Optional keys in `deps_info`:

The following keys will only appear in the `.build_config` files of certain
target types:

* `deps_info['requires_android']`: True to indicate that the corresponding
code uses Android-specific APIs, and thus cannot run on the host within a
regular JVM. May only appear in Java-related targets.

* `deps_info['supports_android']`:
May appear in Java-related targets, and indicates that
the corresponding code doesn't use Java APIs that are not available on
Android. As such it may run either on the host or on an Android device.

* `deps_info['assets']`:
Only seen for the [`android_assets`](#target_android_assets) type. See below.

* `deps_info['package_name']`: Java package name associated with this target.

    NOTE: For `android_resources` targets,
    this is the package name for the corresponding R class. For `android_apk`
    targets, this is the corresponding package name. This does *not* appear for
    other target types.

* `deps_info['android_manifest']`:
Path to an AndroidManifest.xml file related to the current target.

* `deps_info['base_module_config']`:
Only seen for the [`android_app_bundle`](#target_android_app_bundle) type.
Path to the base module for the bundle.

* `deps_info['is_base_module']`:
Only seen for the
[`android_app_bundle_module`](#target_android_app_bundle_module)
type. Whether or not this module is the base module for some bundle.

# Top-level `resources` dictionary:

This dictionary only appears for a few target types that can contain or
relate to Android resources (e.g. `android_resources` or `android_apk`):

* `resources['dependency_zips']`:
List of `deps_info['resources_zip']` entries for all `android_resources`
dependencies for the current target.

* `resource['extra_package_names']`:
Always empty for `android_resources` types. Otherwise,
the list of `deps_info['package_name']` entries for all `android_resources`
dependencies for the current target. Computed automatically by
`write_build_config.py`.

* `resources['extra_r_text_files']`:
Always empty for `android_resources` types. Otherwise, the list of
`deps_info['r_text']` entries for all `android_resources` dependencies for
the current target. Computed automatically.


# `.build_config` target types description:

## <a name="target_group">Target type `group`</a>:

This type corresponds to a simple target that is only used to group
dependencies. It matches the `java_group()` GN template. Its only top-level
`deps_info` keys are `supports_android` (always True), and `deps_configs`.


## <a name="target_android_resources">Target type `android_resources`</a>:

This type corresponds to targets that are used to group Android resource files.
For example, all `android_resources` dependencies of an `android_apk` will
end up packaged into the final APK by the build system.

It uses the following keys:

* `deps_info['resource_dirs']`:
List of paths to the source directories containing the resources for this
target. This key is optional, because some targets can refer to prebuilt
`.aar` archives.


* `deps_info['resources_zip']`:
*Required*. Path to the `.resources.zip` file that contains all raw/uncompiled
resource files for this target (and also no `R.txt`, `R.java` or `R.class`).

    If `deps_info['resource_dirs']` is missing, this must point to a prebuilt
    `.aar` archive containing resources. Otherwise, this will point to a
    zip archive generated at build time, wrapping the content of
    `deps_info['resource_dirs']` into a single zip file.

* `deps_info['package_name']`:
Java package name that the R class for this target belongs to.

* `deps_info['android_manifest']`:
Optional. Path to the top-level Android manifest file associated with these
resources (if not provided, an empty manifest will be used to generate R.txt).

* `deps_info['r_text']`:
Provide the path to the `R.txt` file that describes the resources wrapped by
this target. Normally this file is generated from the content of the resource
directories or zip file, but some targets can provide their own `R.txt` file
if they want.

* `deps_info['srcjar_path']`:
Path to the `.srcjar` file that contains the auto-generated `R.java` source
file corresponding to the content of `deps_info['r_text']`. This is *always*
generated from the content of `deps_info['r_text']` by the
`build/android/gyp/process_resources.py` script.


## <a name="target_android_assets">Target type `android_assets`</a>:

This type corresponds to targets used to group Android assets, i.e. liberal
files that will be placed under `//assets/` within the final APK.

These use an `deps_info['assets']` key to hold a dictionary of values related
to assets covered by this target.

* `assets['sources']`:
The list of all asset source paths for this target. Each source path can
use an optional `:<zipPath>` suffix, where `<zipPath>` is the final location
of the assets (relative to `//assets/`) within the APK.

* `assets['outputs']`:
Optional. Some of the sources might be renamed before being stored in the
final //assets/ sub-directory. When this happens, this contains a list of
all renamed output file paths

    NOTE: When not empty, the first items of `assets['sources']` must match
    every item in this list. Extra sources correspond to non-renamed sources.

    NOTE: This comes from the `asset_renaming_destinations` parameter for the
    `android_assets()` GN template.

* `assets['disable_compression']`:
Optional. Will be True to indicate that these assets should be stored
uncompressed in the final APK. For example, this is necessary for locale
.pak files used by the System WebView feature.

* `assets['treat_as_locale_paks']`:
Optional. Will be True to indicate that these assets are locale `.pak` files
(containing localized strings for C++). These are later processed to generate
a special ``.build_config`.java` source file, listing all supported Locales in
the current build.


## <a name="target_java_library">Target type `java_library`</a>:

This type is used to describe target that wrap Java bytecode, either created
by compiling sources, or providing them with a prebuilt jar.

* `deps_info['unprocessed_jar_path']`:
Path to the original .jar file for this target, before any kind of processing
through Proguard or other tools. For most targets this is generated
from sources, with a name like `$target_name.javac.jar`. However, when using
a prebuilt jar, this will point to the source archive directly.

* `deps_info['jar_path']`:
Path to a file that is the result of processing
`deps_info['unprocessed_jar_path']` with various tools.

* `deps_info['interface_jar_path']:
Path to the interface jar generated for this library. This corresponds to
a jar file that only contains declarations. Generated by running the `ijar`
tool on `deps_info['jar_path']`

* `deps_info['dex_path']`:
Path to the `.dex` file generated for this target, from `deps_info['jar_path']`
unless this comes from a prebuilt `.aar` archive.

* `deps_info['is_prebuilt']`:
True to indicate that this target corresponds to a prebuilt `.jar` file.
In this case, `deps_info['unprocessed_jar_path']` will point to the source
`.jar` file. Otherwise, it will be point to a build-generated file.

* `deps_info['java_sources_file']`:
Path to a single `.sources` file listing all the Java sources that were used
to generate the library (simple text format, one `.jar` path per line).

* `deps_info['owned_resource_dirs']`:
List of all resource directories belonging to all resource dependencies for
this target.

* `deps_info['owned_resource_zips']`:
List of all resource zip files belonging to all resource dependencies for this
target.

* `deps_info['owned_resource_srcjars']`:
List of all .srcjar files belonging to all resource dependencies for this
target.

* `deps_info['javac']`:
A dictionary containing information about the way the sources in this library
are compiled. Appears also on other Java-related targets. See the [dedicated
section about this](#dict_javac) below for details.

* `deps_info['javac_full_classpath']`:
The classpath used when performing bytecode processing. Essentially the
collection of all `deps_info['unprocessed_jar_path']` entries for the target
and all its dependencies.

* `deps_info['javac_full_interface_classpath']`:
The classpath used when using the errorprone compiler.

* `deps_info['proguard_enabled"]`:
True to indicate that ProGuard processing is enabled for this target.

* `deps_info['proguard_configs"]`:
A list of paths to ProGuard configuration files related to this library.

* `deps_info['extra_classpath_jars']:
For some Java related types, a list of extra `.jar` files to use at build time
but not at runtime.

* `deps_info['extra_classpath_interface_jars']:
The interface jars corresponding to extra_classpath_jars.

## <a name="target_java_binary">Target type `java_binary`</a>:

This type corresponds to a Java binary, which is nothing more than a
`java_library` target that also provides a main class name. It thus inherits
all entries from the `java_library` type, and adds:

* `deps_info['main_class']`:
Name of the main Java class that serves as an entry point for the binary.

* `deps_info['java_runtime_classpath']`:
The classpath used when running a Java or Android binary. Essentially the
collection of all `deps_info['jar_path']` entries for the target and all its
dependencies.


## <a name="target_junit_binary">Target type `junit_binary`</a>:

A target type for JUnit-specific binaries. Identical to
[`java_binary`](#target_java_binary) in the context of `.build_config` files,
except the name.


## <a name="target_java_annotation_processor">Target type \
`java_annotation_processor`</a>:

A target type for Java annotation processors. Identical to
[`java_binary`](#target_java_binary) in the context of `.build_config` files,
except the name, except that it requires a `deps_info['main_class']` entry.


## <a name="target_android_apk">Target type `android_apk`</a>:

Corresponds to an Android APK. Inherits from the
[`java_binary`](#target_java_binary) type and adds:

* `deps_info['apk_path']`:
Path to the raw, unsigned, APK generated by this target.

* `deps_info['incremental_apk_path']`:
Path to the raw, unsigned, incremental APK generated by this target.

* `deps_info['incremental_install_json_path']`:
Path to the JSON file with per-apk details for incremental install.
See `build/android/gyp/incremental/write_installer_json.py` for more
details about its content.

* `deps_info['dist_jar']['all_interface_jars']`:
For `android_apk` and `dist_jar` targets, a list of all interface jar files
that will be merged into the final `.jar` file for distribution.

* `deps_info['final_dex']['path']`:
Path to the final classes.dex file (or classes.zip in case of multi-dex)
for this APK.

* `deps_info['final_dex']['dependency_dex_files']`:
The list of paths to all `deps_info['dex_path']` entries for all library
dependencies for this APK.

* `native['libraries']`
List of native libraries for the primary ABI to be embedded in this APK.
E.g. [ "libchrome.so" ] (i.e. this doesn't include any ABI sub-directory
prefix).

* `native['java_libraries_list']`
The same list as `native['libraries']` as a string holding a Java source
fragment, e.g. `"{\"chrome\"}"`, without any `lib` prefix, and `.so`
suffix (as expected by `System.loadLibrary()`).

* `native['second_abi_libraries']`
List of native libraries for the secondary ABI to be embedded in this APK.
Empty if only a single ABI is supported.

* `native['uncompress_shared_libraries']`
A boolean indicating whether native libraries are stored uncompressed in the
APK.

* `native['extra_shared_libraries']`
A list of native libraries to store within the APK, in addition to those from
`native['libraries']`. These correspond to things like the Chromium linker
or instrumentation libraries.

* `assets`
A list of assets stored compressed in the APK. Each entry has the format
`<source-path>:<destination-path>`, where `<source-path>` is relative to
`$CHROMIUM_OUTPUT_DIR`, and `<destination-path>` is relative to `//assets/`
within the APK.

NOTE: Not to be confused with the `deps_info['assets']` dictionary that
belongs to `android_assets` targets only.

* `uncompressed_assets`
A list of uncompressed assets stored in the APK. Each entry has the format
`<source-path>:<destination-path>` too.

* `compressed_locales_java_list`
A string holding a Java source fragment that gives the list of locales stored
compressed in the `//assets/` directory. E.g. `"{\"am\","\ar\",\"en-US\"}"`.
Note that the files will be stored with the `.pak` extension (e.g.
`//assets/en-US.pak`).

* `uncompressed_locales_java_list`
A string holding a Java source fragment that gives the list of locales stored
uncompressed in the `//assets/stored-locales/` directory. These are used for
the System WebView feature only. Note that the files will be stored with the
`.pak` extension (e.g. `//assets/stored-locales/en-US.apk`).

* `extra_android_manifests`
A list of `deps_configs['android_manifest]` entries, for all resource
dependencies for this target. I.e. a list of paths to manifest files for
all the resources in this APK. These will be merged with the root manifest
file to generate the final one used to build the APK.

* `java_resources_jars`
This is a list of `.jar` files whose *Java* resources should be included in
the final APK. For example, this is used to copy the `.res` files from the
EMMA Coverage tool. The copy will omit any `.class` file and the top-level
`//meta-inf/` directory from the input jars. Everything else will be copied
into the final APK as-is.

NOTE: This has nothing to do with *Android* resources.

* `jni['all_source']`
The list of all `deps_info['java_sources_file']` entries for all library
dependencies for this APK. Note: this is a list of files, where each file
contains a list of Java source files. This is used for JNI registration.

* `deps_info['proguard_all_configs']`:
The collection of all 'deps_info['proguard_configs']` values from this target
and all its dependencies.

* `deps_info['proguard_classpath_jars']`:
The collection of all 'deps_info['extra_classpath_jars']` values from all
dependencies.

* `deps_info['proguard_under_test_mapping']`:
Applicable to apks with proguard enabled that have an apk_under_test. This is
the path to the apk_under_test's output proguard .mapping file.

## <a name="target_android_app_bundle_module">Target type \
`android_app_bundle_module`</a>:

Corresponds to an Android app bundle module. Very similar to an APK and
inherits the same fields, except that this does not generate an installable
file (see `android_app_bundle`), and for the following omitted fields:

* `deps_info['apk_path']`, `deps_info['incremental_apk_path']` and
  `deps_info['incremental_install_json_path']` are omitted.

* top-level `dist_jar` is omitted as well.

In addition to `android_apk` targets though come these new fields:

* `deps_info['proto_resources_path']`:
The path of an zip archive containing the APK's resources compiled to the
protocol buffer format (instead of regular binary xml + resources.arsc).

* `deps_info['module_rtxt_path']`:
The path of the R.txt file generated when compiling the resources for the bundle
module.

* `deps_info['module_pathmap_path']`:
The path of the pathmap file generated when compiling the resources for the
bundle module, if resource path shortening is enabled.

* `deps_info['base_whitelist_rtxt_path']`:
Optional path to an R.txt file used as a whitelist for base string resources.
This means that any string resource listed in this file *and* in
`deps_info['module_rtxt_path']` will end up in the base split APK of any
`android_app_bundle` target that uses this target as its base module.

This ensures that such localized strings are available to all bundle installs,
even when language based splits are enabled (e.g. required for WebView strings
inside the Monochrome bundle).


## <a name="target_android_app_bundle">Target type `android_app_bundle`</a>

This target type corresponds to an Android app bundle, and is built from one
or more `android_app_bundle_module` targets listed as dependencies.


## <a name="target_dist_aar">Target type `dist_aar`</a>:

This type corresponds to a target used to generate an `.aar` archive for
distribution. The archive's content is determined by the target's dependencies.

This always has the following entries:

  * `deps_info['supports_android']` (always True).
  * `deps_info['requires_android']` (always True).
  * `deps_info['proguard_configs']` (optional).


## <a name="target_dist_jar">Target type `dist_jar`</a>:

This type is similar to [`dist_aar`](#target_dist_aar) but is not
Android-specific, and used to create a `.jar` file that can be later
redistributed.

This always has the following entries:

  * `deps_info['proguard_enabled']` (False by default).
  * `deps_info['proguard_configs']` (optional).
  * `deps_info['supports_android']` (True by default).
  * `deps_info['requires_android']` (False by default).



## <a name="target_resource_rewriter">Target type `resource_rewriter`</a>:

The ResourceRewriter Java class is in charge of rewriting resource IDs at
runtime, for the benefit of the System WebView feature. This is a special
target type for it.

Its `.build_config` only keeps a list of dependencies in its
`deps_info['deps_configs']` key.

## <a name="dict_javac">The `deps_info['javac']` dictionary</a>:

This dictionary appears in Java-related targets (e.g. `java_library`,
`android_apk` and others), and contains information related to the compilation
of Java sources, class files, and jars.

* `javac['resource_packages']`
For `java_library` targets, this is the list of package names for all resource
dependencies for the current target. Order must match the one from
`javac['srcjars']`. For other target types, this key does not exist.

* `javac['classpath']`
The classpath used to compile this target when annotation processors are
present.

* `javac['interface_classpath']`
The classpath used to compile this target when annotation processors are
not present. These are also always used to known when a target needs to be
rebuilt.

* `javac['processor_classpath']`
The classpath listing the jars used for annotation processors. I.e. sent as
`-processorpath` when invoking `javac`.

* `javac['processor_classes']`
The list of annotation processor main classes. I.e. sent as `-processor' when
invoking `javac`.

## <a name="android_app_bundle">Target type `android_app_bundle`</a>:

This type corresponds to an Android app bundle (`.aab` file).
