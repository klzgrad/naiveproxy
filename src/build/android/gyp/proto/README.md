# Protos
These protos are generated from Resources.proto and Configuration.proto from the
Android repo. They are found in the frameworks/base/tools/aapt2/ directory. To
regenerate these if there are changes, run this command from the root of an
Android checkout:

   protoc --python_out=some_dir frameworks/base/tools/aapt2/Resources.proto \
      frameworks/base/tools/aapt2/Configuration.proto

Then copy the resulting \*pb2.py files from some_dir here. To make sure
Resources_pb2.py is able to import Configuration_pb2.py, remove the
"from frameworks.base.tools.aapt2" portion of the import statement so it will
instead be imported from the current directory.
