# Changes to integration with the Fuchsia platform, or peer components, require
# security review to avoid introducing sandbox escapes. These include:
# - Critical platform integrations (e.g. shared memory, process launching).
# - Changes to Chromium-defined Fuchsia IPC (aka FIDL) protocols.
# - Addition of new FIDL services to child process sandboxes.
# - Addition of new FIDL clients and implementations.
#
# Security team: If you are uncomfortable reviewing a particular bit of code
# yourself, don't hesitate to seek help from another security team member!
# Nobody knows everything, and the only way to learn is from experience.

# Please keep reviewers ordered alphabetically by LDAP.
