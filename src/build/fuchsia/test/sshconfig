# When expanded, the ControlPath below cannot have more than 90 characters
# (total of 108 minus 18 used by a random suffix added by ssh).
# '%C' expands to 40 chars and there are 9 fixed chars, so '~' can expand to
# up to 41 chars, which is a reasonable limit for a user's home in most
# situations. If '~' expands to more than 41 chars, the ssh connection
# will fail with an error like:

# A possible solution is to use /tmp instead of ~, but it has
# its own security concerns.
