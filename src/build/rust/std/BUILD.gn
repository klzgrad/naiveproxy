# This file provides the ability for our C++ toolchain to successfully
# link binaries containing arbitrary Rust code.
#
# By "arbitrary Rust code" I mean .rlib archives full of Rust code, which
# is actually a static archive.
#
# Those static libraries don't link as-is into a final executable because
# they're designed for downstream processing by further invocations of rustc
# which link into a final binary. That final invocation of rustc knows how
# to do two things:
# * Find the Rust standard library.
# * Remap some generic allocator symbols to the specific allocator symbols
#   in use.
# This file does both those things. Any C++ target containing Rust .rlibs
# should simply depend on :std within this file and it will be taken care of.
# In practice, this will in future be taken care of by a standard template
# used for each Rust source set, so that a typical user of Rust need not
# think about it.
#
# This is obviously a bit fragile - rustc might do other magic in future.
# But, linking with a final C++ toolchain is something often needed, and
# https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64191 aims to make this
# officially possible.

    # We are using prebuilt Rust rlibs supplied along with the toolchain.
    # The Rust standard library consists of rlibs with roughly all the names
    # above.
    #
    # However, their filenames are not predictable, and therefore we can't
    # have ninja rules which depend upon them. (gn offers a facility to
    # build rules dynamically, but it's frowned upon because a script needs
    # to run each time).
    #
    # Instead therefore we copy these unpredictable .rlib paths to apredictable
    # location. That's what this script does. Furthermore, it generates a
    # .d file in order to teach Ninja that it only needs to do this copying
    # once, unless the source .rlibs change.
    #
    # The script accepts the list of known libraries and will raise an
    # exception if the list on disk differs. (Either 'Found stdlib rlib
    # that wasn't expected' or 'We failed to find all expected stdlib
    # rlibs').
