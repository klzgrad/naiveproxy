# A fuzzable_proto_library is a proto_library that is the same as any other in
# non-fuzzer builds (ie: use_libfuzzer=false). However, in fuzzer builds, the
# proto_library is built with the full protobuf runtime and any "optimize_for =
# LITE_RUNTIME" options are ignored. This is done because libprotobuf-mutator
# needs the full protobuf runtime, but proto_libraries shipped in chrome must
# use the optimize for LITE_RUNTIME option which is incompatible with the full
# protobuf runtime. tl;dr: A fuzzable_proto_library is a proto_library that can
# be fuzzed with libprotobuf-mutator and shipped in Chrome.
