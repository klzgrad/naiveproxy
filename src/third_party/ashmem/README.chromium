Patches:
  0001-Add-ashmem-get-prot-region.path:
     Add ashmem_get_prot_region() declaration and implementation to return
     the current protection mask of a given Ashmem region.
  0002-Use-AShareMemory-functions-when-possible.patch:
     Use ASharedMemory_xxx() functions from libandroid.so when possible
     in order to prepare for future devices without ashmem support.
  0003-Pthread-once-for-funcs-init.patch:
     Fix the data race that was introduced in the previous patch by using
     pthread_once() for function pointers initialization.
  0004-Fixup-ashmem_get_prot_region-for-memfd.patch:
     mmap with MAP_PRIVATE is meant to succeed even on write-protected
     memfd's as it will just copy-on-write.
