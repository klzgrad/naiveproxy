# These options are used when building our own SQLite library, which happens
# everywhere except on iOS. These compile-time options are exported via a
# public_config to all targets using SQLite, because they're needed by the
# sqlite.h header. To avoid name clashes (macro names are resolved using a
# global namespace), this block should only contain preprocessor macros that
# are unambiguously connected to SQLite.
