# TODO(crbug.com/1026488): Consider moving all service worker mojom files into
# this BUILD.gn and figure out right dependencies for them. Currently mojom
# files other than "storage" target are listed in blink/public/mojom/BUILD.gn.

# This is separated from the rest of the other service worker mojom files
# to avoid introducing a dependency on the entire public blink platform for
# non-blink dependents.
