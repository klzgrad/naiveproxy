// The result of dispatching an event to a service worker.
enum ServiceWorkerEventStatus {
  // The event dispatch completed successfully.
  COMPLETED,

  // Only for extendable events. A promise passed to waitUntil() or
  // respondWith() was rejected. It may also mean dispatch failed, but the
  // meaning of that depends on the event type. It could possibly mean
  // JavaScript execution was forcibly terminated or an uncaught runtime
  // script error occurred while dispatching. For FetchEvent, it looks
  // like we set REJECTED when the service worker did not provide a
  // response but defaultPrevented() was called, preventing falling back
  // to network.
  REJECTED,

  // The service worker execution context was destroyed while the event was alive.
  ABORTED,

  // The event failed to finish within the time limit.
  TIMEOUT,

  MAX=TIMEOUT

// Currently these all mean that start succeeded as this enum is only used in
// EmbeddedWorkerInstanceHost.OnStarted() which indicates startup completed.
// The plan is to expand to include error codes too.
