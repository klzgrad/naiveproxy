// Debugging interactions are defined in Remote Debugging Protocol.
// See https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/ for more
// information on the protocol itself.
//
// All interfaces defined here serve as a transport level for the
// remote debugging protocol, passing messages opaquely between debugging
// client (like DevTools frontend) and debugging agent (like core/inspector).

// Implemented by debugging targets which expose remote debugging protocol.
// Examples are local frame roots and service workers.
//
// Note that frame instances of this interface must be associated with
// navigation-related interface, since we should reattach sessions before
// the navigation commits in the frame.
//
// This interface is implemented in renderer hosting entity under debug.
// Note that this interface just provides a mean to start a debugging session,
// so the presence of it does not mean the entity is under debug just yet.
interface DevToolsAgent {
  // Attaches a new debugging session. This session speaks remote debugging
  // protocol and restores all the changes to original state once destroyed.
  //
  // Associated |session| receives messages on UI thread and guarantees
  // relative ordering with e.g. navigations.
  //
  // Non-associated |io_session| receives messages on IO thread and may
  // interrupt long running JavaScript on the main thread. It should be used
  // for debugging messages which are intended to interrupt execution,
  // e.g. requesting a pause. There is no ordering guarantee relative to
  // regular |session|.
  //
  // If |reattach_session_state| is present, restores the state of the session
  // to previously saved one (see DevToolsSessionHost). This is useful when
  // transferring a session from one agent to another while preserving the
  // state. For example, cross-process navigation in a frame creates a new
  // DevToolsAgent (in a different process), but we can preserve the state of
  // debugging session by copying it from one agent to another.
  //
  // ------ Why separate sessions? ------
  //
  // To guarantee ordering with legacy IPC channel, we must bind session
  // synchronously on the UI thread. Otherwise there is a time window
  // when the request is not yet bound, but the messages may already come.
  // In this case, messages will be sent to UI hoping that interface
  // is bound there, and get incorrectly dispatched.
  //
  // On the other hand, we need to handle some of the messages on IO without
  // going to UI first (as described above). This means an interface bound
  // on IO thread. Thus a session per thread.
  //
  // Note that |io_session| is not associated with DevToolsAgent, and so
  // there is no ordering guarantee for commands send to |io_session|
  // relative to anything coming over regular |session|.
  // For example, |session| may be already detached (interface unbound),
  // while commands are still coming to |io_session|, and vice versa.
  //
  // |client_expects_binary_response| indicates that responses (and
  // notifications) sent from this session should use binary (CBOR)
  // encoding as opposed to JSON encoding.
  //
  // |session_id| is a string which, if provided, uniquely identifies the
  // session. The renderer must send this back with each response. The current
  // implementation uses the string serialization of an UnguessableToken, but
  // that is subject to change.
