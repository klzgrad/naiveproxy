Description:
Brotli is a generic byte-level compression algorithm that is used at the
byte-compression level in WOFF 2.0 font file format. This library is used
to decode WOFF 2.0 fonts and "Content-Encoding: br" responses.

Some speed measurements to compare with //third_party/zlib were taken:

At low compression levels, brotli is faster at compressing than zlib. At
higher compression levels, brotli or zlib can be faster at compressing,
depending on the data being compressed. At all compression levels, brotli
decompresses roughly 1.6-2.0x slower than zlib.
