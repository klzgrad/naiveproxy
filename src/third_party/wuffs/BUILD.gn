# Most third_party/foobar dependencies are libraries that do one thing: e.g. a
# particular codec, regular expressions, a SQL database, etc. Wuffs is unusual
# in two respects:
#
# - The Wuffs project is both a programming language, and a standard library
#   written in that programming language (and then transpiled to C). As of
#   November 2019, Chromium uses only Wuffs-the-library.
#
# - That standard library speaks many codecs. As of November 2019, compression
#   and images, but in the future, this may grow in scope.
#
# Third_party/foobar dependencies need to be reviewed before they are added:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/docs/adding_to_third_party.md#Get-a-review
#
# Normally, this review is a one-off process: once third_party/foobar is
# accepted, it doesn't need additional review for e.g. version upgrades.
# Because Wuffs is many things, substantial changes (newer versions or newer
# configurations) deserve additional review just as if they were a new
# third_party dependency. This is especially so for Wuffs-the-language, as
# adding a new programming language to Chromium has a very high bar.
#
# In summary, non-trivial changes to how Chromium uses third_party/wuffs (i.e.
# this BUILD.gn file), both adding new build targets or changing existing build
# targets' configuration or visibility, require consulting ENG_REVIEW_OWNERS,
# as per the "adding_to_third_party.md" link above.

    # Defining the WUFFS_CONFIG__MODULE* macros are optional, but it lets users
    # of Wuffs' .c file whitelist which parts of Wuffs to build. That file
    # contains the entire Wuffs standard library, implementing a variety of
    # codecs and file formats. Without this macro definition, an optimizing
    # compiler or linker may very well discard Wuffs code for unused codecs,
    # but listing the Wuffs modules we use makes that process explicit.
    # Preprocessing means that such code simply isn't compiled.
