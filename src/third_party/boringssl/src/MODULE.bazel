# Periodically update the following dependencies to their latest versions

# `bazelisk test ...` to update the hashes in MODULE.bazel.lock.

# In principle, googletest is only needed for tests and could be a
# dev_dependency. But it would then be impossible for downstream modules to run
# BoringSSL's tests. The downstream module provides the toolchain, so we may
# need to request they run tests when triaging issues. If
# https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22187 is ever fixed, we can change
# this.
