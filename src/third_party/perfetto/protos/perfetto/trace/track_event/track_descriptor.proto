// A TrackDescriptor only needs to be emitted by one trace writer / producer and
// is valid for the entirety of the trace. To ensure the descriptor isn't lost
// when the ring buffer wraps, it should be reemitted whenever incremental state
// is cleared.
//
// As a fallback, TrackEvents emitted without an explicit track association will
// be associated with an implicit trace-global track (uuid = 0), see also
// |TrackEvent::track_uuid|. It is possible but not necessary to emit a
// TrackDescriptor for this implicit track.

  // thread, specify the uuid for that thread's thread track here. In general,
  // setting a parent will *nest* that track under the parent in the UI and in
  // the trace processor data model (with the important exception noted below).
