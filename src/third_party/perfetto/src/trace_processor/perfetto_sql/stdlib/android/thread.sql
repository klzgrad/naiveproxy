-- Standardizes an Android thread name by extracting its core identifier to make it
-- possible to aggregate by name.
--
-- Removes extra parts of a thread name, like identifiers, leaving only the main prefix.
-- Splits the name at ('-', '[', ':' , ' ').
--
-- Some Examples:
--   Given thread_name = "RenderThread-1[123]",
--   returns "RenderThread".
--
--   Given thread_name = "binder:5543_E"
--   returns "binder".
--
--   Given thread_name = "pool-3-thread-5",
--   returns "pool".
--
--   Given thread_name = "MainThread",
--   returns "MainThread".
