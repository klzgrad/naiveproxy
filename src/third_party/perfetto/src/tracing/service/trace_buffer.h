class TracePacket;

// The main buffer, owned by the tracing service, where all the trace data is
// ultimately stored into. The service will own several instances of this class,
// at least one per active consumer (as defined in the |buffers| section of
// trace_config.proto) and will copy chunks from the producer's shared memory
// buffers into here when a CommitData IPC is received.
//
// Writing into the buffer
// -----------------------
// Data is copied from the SMB(s) using CopyChunkUntrusted(). The buffer will
// hence contain data coming from different producers and different writer
// sequences, more specifically:
// - The service receives data by several producer(s), identified by their ID.
// - Each producer writes several sequences identified by the same WriterID.
//   (they correspond to TraceWriter instances in the producer).
// - Each Writer writes, in order, several chunks.
// - Each chunk contains zero, one, or more TracePacket(s), or even just
//   fragments of packets (when they span across several chunks).
//
// So at any point in time, the buffer will contain a variable number of logical
// sequences identified by the {ProducerID, WriterID} tuple. Any given chunk
// will only contain packets (or fragments) belonging to the same sequence.
//
// The buffer operates by default as a ring buffer.
// It has two overwrite policies:
//  1. kOverwrite (default): if the write pointer reaches the read pointer, old
//     unread chunks will be overwritten by new chunks.
//  2. kDiscard: if the write pointer reaches the read pointer, unread chunks
//     are preserved and the new chunks are discarded. Any future write becomes
//     a no-op, even if the reader manages to fully catch up. This is because
//     once a chunk is discarded, the sequence of packets is broken and trying
//     to recover would be too hard (also due to the fact that, at the same
//     time, we allow out-of-order commits and chunk re-writes).
//
// Chunks are (over)written in the same order of the CopyChunkUntrusted() calls.
// When overwriting old content, entire chunks are overwritten or clobbered.
// The buffer never leaves a partial chunk around. Chunks' payload is copied
// as-is, but their header is not and is repacked in order to keep the
// ProducerID around.
//
// Chunks are stored in the buffer next to each other. Each chunk is prefixed by
// an inline header (ChunkRecord), which contains most of the fields of the
// SharedMemoryABI ChunkHeader + the ProducerID + the size of the payload.
// It's a conventional binary object stream essentially, where each ChunkRecord
// tells where it ends and hence where to find the next one, like this:
//
//          .-------------------------. 16 byte boundary
//          | ChunkRecord:   16 bytes |
//          | - chunk id:     4 bytes |
//          | - producer id:  2 bytes |
//          | - writer id:    2 bytes |
//          | - #fragments:   2 bytes |
//    +-----+ - record size:  2 bytes |
//    |     | - flags+pad:    4 bytes |
//    |     +-------------------------+
//    |     |                         |
//    |     :     Chunk payload       :
//    |     |                         |
//    |     +-------------------------+
//    |     |    Optional padding     |
//    +---> +-------------------------+ 16 byte boundary
//          |      ChunkRecord        |
//          :                         :
// Chunks stored in the buffer are always rounded up to 16 bytes (that is
// sizeof(ChunkRecord)), in order to avoid further inner fragmentation.
// Special "padding" chunks can be put in the buffer, e.g. in the case when we
// try to write a chunk of size N while the write pointer is at the end of the
// buffer, but the write pointer is < N bytes from the end (and hence needs to
// wrap over).
// Because of this, the buffer is self-describing: the contents of the buffer
// can be reconstructed by just looking at the buffer content (this will be
// quite useful in future to recover the buffer from crash reports).
//
// However, in order to keep some operations (patching and reading) fast, a
// lookaside index is maintained (in |index_|), keeping each chunk in the buffer
// indexed by their {ProducerID, WriterID, ChunkID} tuple.
//
// Patching data out-of-band
// -------------------------
// This buffer also supports patching chunks' payload out-of-band, after they
// have been stored. This is to allow producers to backfill the "size" fields
// of the protos that spawn across several chunks, when the previous chunks are
// returned to the service. The MaybePatchChunkContents() deals with the fact
// that a chunk might have been lost (because of wrapping) by the time the OOB
// IPC comes.
//
// Reading from the buffer
// -----------------------
// This class supports one reader only (the consumer). Reads are NOT idempotent
// as they move the read cursors around. Reading back the buffer is the most
// conceptually complex part. The ReadNextTracePacket() method operates with
// whole packet granularity. Packets are returned only when all their fragments
// are available.
// This class takes care of:
// - Gluing packets within the same sequence, even if they are not stored
//   adjacently in the buffer.
// - Re-ordering chunks within a sequence (using the ChunkID, which wraps).
// - Detecting holes in packet fragments (because of loss of chunks).
// Reads guarantee that packets for the same sequence are read in FIFO order
// (according to their ChunkID), but don't give any guarantee about the read
// order of packets from different sequences, see comments in
// ReadNextTracePacket() below.
