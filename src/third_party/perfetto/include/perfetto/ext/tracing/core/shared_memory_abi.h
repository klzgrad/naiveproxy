// This file defines the binary interface of the memory buffers shared between
// Producer and Service. This is a long-term stable ABI and has to be backwards
// compatible to deal with mismatching Producer and Service versions.
//
// Overview
// --------
// SMB := "Shared Memory Buffer".
// In the most typical case of a multi-process architecture (i.e. Producer and
// Service are hosted by different processes), a Producer means almost always
// a "client process producing data" (almost: in some cases a process might host
// > 1 Producer, if it links two libraries, independent of each other, that both
// use Perfetto tracing).
// The Service has one SMB for each Producer.
// A producer has one or (typically) more data sources. They all share the same
// SMB.
// The SMB is a staging area to decouple data sources living in the Producer
// and allow them to do non-blocking async writes.
// The SMB is *not* the ultimate logging buffer seen by the Consumer. That one
// is larger (~MBs) and not shared with Producers.
// Each SMB is small, typically few KB. Its size is configurable by the producer
// within a max limit of ~MB (see kMaxShmSize in tracing_service_impl.cc).
// The SMB is partitioned into fixed-size Page(s). The size of the Pages are
// determined by each Producer at connection time and cannot be changed.
// Hence, different producers can have SMB(s) that have a different Page size
// from each other, but the page size will be constant throughout all the
// lifetime of the SMB.
// Page(s) are partitioned by the Producer into variable size Chunk(s):
//
// +------------+      +--------------------------+
// | Producer 1 |  <-> |      SMB 1 [~32K - 1MB]  |
// +------------+      +--------+--------+--------+
//                     |  Page  |  Page  |  Page  |
//                     +--------+--------+--------+
//                     | Chunk  |        | Chunk  |
//                     +--------+  Chunk +--------+ <----+
//                     | Chunk  |        | Chunk  |      |
//                     +--------+--------+--------+      +---------------------+
//                                                       |       Service       |
// +------------+      +--------------------------+      +---------------------+
// | Producer 2 |  <-> |      SMB 2 [~32K - 1MB]  |     /| large ring buffers  |
// +------------+      +--------+--------+--------+ <--+ | (100K - several MB) |
//                     |  Page  |  Page  |  Page  |      +---------------------+
//                     +--------+--------+--------+
//                     | Chunk  |        | Chunk  |
//                     +--------+  Chunk +--------+
//                     | Chunk  |        | Chunk  |
//                     +--------+--------+--------+
//
// * Sizes of both SMB and ring buffers are purely indicative and decided at
// configuration time by the Producer (for SMB sizes) and the Consumer (for the
// final ring buffer size).

// Page
// ----
// A page is a portion of the shared memory buffer and defines the granularity
// of the interaction between the Producer and tracing Service. When scanning
// the shared memory buffer to determine if something should be moved to the
// central logging buffers, the Service most of the times looks at and moves
// whole pages. Similarly, the Producer sends an IPC to invite the Service to
// drain the shared memory buffer only when a whole page is filled.
// Having fixed the total SMB size (hence the total memory overhead), the page
// size is a triangular tradeoff between:
// 1) IPC traffic: smaller pages -> more IPCs.
// 2) Producer lock freedom: larger pages -> larger chunks -> data sources can
//    write more data without needing to swap chunks and synchronize.
// 3) Risk of write-starving the SMB: larger pages -> higher chance that the
//    Service won't manage to drain them and the SMB remains full.
// The page size, on the other side, has no implications on wasted memory due to
// fragmentations (see Chunk below).
// The size of the page is chosen by the Service at connection time and stays
// fixed throughout all the lifetime of the Producer. Different producers (i.e.
// ~ different client processes) can use different page sizes.
// The page size must be an integer multiple of 4k (this is to allow VM page
// stealing optimizations) and obviously has to be an integer divisor of the
// total SMB size.

// Chunk
// -----
// A chunk is a portion of a Page which is written and handled by a Producer.
// A chunk contains a linear sequence of TracePacket(s) (the root proto).
// A chunk cannot be written concurrently by two data sources. Protobufs must be
// encoded as contiguous byte streams and cannot be interleaved. Therefore, on
// the Producer side, a chunk is almost always owned exclusively by one thread
// (% extremely peculiar slow-path cases).
// Chunks are essentially single-writer single-thread lock-free arenas. Locking
// happens only when a Chunk is full and a new one needs to be acquired.
// Locking happens only within the scope of a Producer process. There is no
// inter-process locking. The Producer cannot lock the Service and viceversa.
// In the worst case, any of the two can starve the SMB, by marking all chunks
// as either being read or written. But that has the only side effect of
// losing the trace data.
// The Producer can decide to partition each page into a number of limited
// configurations (e.g., 1 page == 1 chunk, 1 page == 2 chunks and so on).

// TracePacket
// -----------
// Is the atom of tracing. Putting aside pages and chunks a trace is merely a
// sequence of TracePacket(s). TracePacket is the root protobuf message.
// A TracePacket can span across several chunks (hence even across several
// pages). A TracePacket can therefore be >> chunk size, >> page size and even
// >> SMB size. The Chunk header carries metadata to deal with the TracePacket
// splitting case.

// Use only explicitly-sized types below. DO NOT use size_t or any architecture
// dependent size (e.g. size_t) in the struct fields. This buffer will be read
// and written by processes that have a different bitness in the same OS.
// Instead it's fine to assume little-endianess. Big-endian is a dream we are
// not currently pursuing.
