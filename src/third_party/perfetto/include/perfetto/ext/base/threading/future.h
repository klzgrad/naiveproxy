// Creates a Future<T> from P, a subclass of FuturePollable<T>.

// primitives but any can also be any moveable type.
//
// This function follows the same pattern of std::make_unique, std::make_shared
// etc.

// A value of type T which is computed asynchronously.
//
// The result of long running compute/IO operations may not be available
// immediately. This class acts as a representation of the value which will be
// produced at some point in the future. Callers can then be notified of the
// result once it's available to be processed.
//
// This class takes heavy inspiration from the implementation of Futures in
// Rust. Specifically, this implementation is:
//  - pull-based/lazy: Futures do nothing until "polled" i.e. driven to
//    completion by a base::TaskRunner. The implementation of this is provided
//    by base::TaskRunnerPoller.
//  - backpressured: because futures are "polled", the result is only
//    requested when it can be processed on the base::TaskRunner thread.
//  - cancellable: by just destroying the future the computation can be
//    cancelled. Note, that the implementation of the source future still needs
//    to propogate cancellation across thread/socket/pipe boundary.
//
// Note: Futures *must* be polled on the same thread on which they wereÂ created.
// The |SpawnResultFuture| can be used to move the results of Futures between
// threads in a safe manner.
//
// Implementation note:
// An important point to note is that Future<T> is a final class. Implementation
// of Future<T>::Poll happens through an indirection layer by implementing the
// FuturePollable<T> interface. This allows for the
// unique_ptr<FuturePollable<T>> to be hidden, making callsites nicer while
// also allowing useful "helper" functions like |ContinueWith| to live on the
// class rather than as free functions.
