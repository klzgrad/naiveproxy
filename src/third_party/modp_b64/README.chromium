Description:
The source code was modified from upstream as follows:
- Removed the inclusion of modp's config.h
- Fixed compilation errors that occur under VC8
- Renamed modp_b64.c to modp_b64.cc to force it to be compiled as C++ and so
  the inclusion of basictypes.h could be possible
- Made code safe on 64-bit systems
- Removed misaligned read/writes on little-endian systems
- Removed unreachable code
- Extended the API so callers can avoid overload for base64 encode
- Removed big endian support entirely
- Removed std::string APIs
- Added multiple decoding options to support Blink callers
- Added modp_b64_encode_data which doesn't append a null terminator
