Compilation with Nasm on MSVC 6.0, with usage of Custom Build step.

1) Open your project in MSVC.

2) Add .asm at the list of source files.

3) Click on it with the right button, further press Settings...

4) In General tab, flags "Always use custom build step" and "Exclude file
   from build" should be disabled.

5) In "Custom Build" tab it is necessary to define "Commands" and "Outputs"
   (By "Outputs" build system checks if it has reached a necessary result.
    This parameter is mandatory and without it MSVC will not let you close
    the window by OK button).

   The "Commands" should be set to

        nasmw.exe -fwin -o $(OUTDIR)\$(InputName).obj $(InputName).asm

   And "Outputs" to

        $(OUTDIR)\$(InputName).obj

Have fun!
