--[ DESCRIPTION ] ------------------
This contains the source to NASM, the assembler used for parts of Chromium.


--[ PATCHES ] ------------------
* See README.patches for the full listing.

If you make any changes to nasm which are not in upstream, please update the
README.patches file with the following command:

  ./find_patches.py > README.patches

Note: This script only works if you have added upstream as a remote per the
directions in updating below.


--[ UPDATING ] ------------------
To update, have clang in your system path (from //third_party/llvm-
build/Release+Asserts/bin) then do the following:

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm.git
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/master

  # Maybe use git mergetool to resolve any conflicts with local patches.

  # ***DO NOT USE*** git cl upload for this part or you will spam every author
  # who committed something upstream with a Gerrit issue... :O You must also
  # have the correct Gerrit permissions from one of the OWNERS to do this.
  git push origin master

  # You can safely use git cl upload for all of your own modifications past this
  # point; I.e., once you have pushed all the commits from the git merge.

  CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-std=c11 -Werror" ./autogen.sh
  CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-std=c11 -Werror" ./configure
  make perlreq
  ./generate_nasm_sources.py
  git add <any new .c/.h files which show up>

  # Copy config/config.h to config-(mac|linux).h
  # Revert config/config.h to the checked in version
  ./generate_nasm_configs.py

  git commit -a


--[ CONFIG_H_ ] ------------------
In the event any new config.h flags are added, you may need to regenerate the
config.h for Linux and Mac -- maybe for Windows if they haven't fixed msvc.h.

To run the script on macOS you can follow the same instructions as above after
setting up autoconf; with Homebrew: brew install autoconf automake libtool

You will likely need to set SDKROOT to point to the macOS SDK if you haven't
setup Xcode in the past. If you have the hermetic macOS toolchain in your
checkout just add:

export SDKROOT=$path_to_chrome_src/build/mac_files/xcode_binaries/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk

You can stop after configure. Then just follow the copy instructions above.


--[ TODOS ] ------------------
None at this time.
