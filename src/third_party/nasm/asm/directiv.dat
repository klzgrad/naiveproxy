;; List of global NASM directives and pragma operations codes
;;
;; ALL directives, including backend-specific, need to be added here.
;;
;; %pragma operation keywords (the second word, after facility) MAY
;; be added here too to assist in parsing, but it is not required.
;; See the definition of struct pragma in include/nasm.h.
;;
;; The same keyword can be used as a directive and as a pragma
;; operation, or as pragma operations in different namespaces.  The
;; same D_ constant will be used for both, and this is perfectly
;; acceptable.
;;
;; In the future, this will be turned into a general list of keywords
;; to be parsed in special contexts.
