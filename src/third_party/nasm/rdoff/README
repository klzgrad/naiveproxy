This file is getting obsolete. RDOFF documentation is written in Texinfo now.
Directory doc/ contains Texinfo source (rdoff.texi) and makefile for creating
different output formats (info, HTML, PostScript and PDF).

RDOFF Utilities, version 0.3.2
==============================

The files contained in this directory are the C source code of a set
of tools (and general purpose library files) for the manipulation of
RDOFF version 2 object files. Note that these programs (with the
exception of 'rdfdump') will NOT work with version 1 object files.
Version 1 of RDOFF is no longer supported.

There is also a 'doc' directory with 'v1-v2' file, which documents the
differences between RDOFF 1 and 2, and an 'rdoff2.texi' (texinfo source),
with complete documentation for the new format.

Here is a brief summary of the programs' usage:


rdfdump
=======

This tool prints a list of the header records in an RDOFF object in
human-readable form, and optionally prints a hex dump of the contents
of the segments.

Usage:
	rdfdump [-v] filename

The -v flag specifies that the hex dump (see above) should be printed.

Changes from previous versions:

* rdfdump supports both version 1 and 2 of RDOFF.
* rdfdump now gives warnings if the RDOFF2 format is violated (it
  looks for incorrect lengths for header records, and checks the
  overall length count at the start of the file)


ldrdf
=====

This tool is a version of unix 'ld' (or DOS 'link') for use with RDOFF
files. It is capable of linking RDOFF objects, and libraries produced
with the 'rdlib' utility discussed below.

In normal usage, its command line takes the form:

	ldrdf [-o output-file] object files [-llibrary ...]

Modules in libraries are not linked to the program unless they are
referred to.

Most of its options are not implemented, but those that are are listed here:

  -2	redirect all output from stderr to stdout. It is useful for some
  	systems which don't have such a redirection in shell (e.g. DOS).

  -v	increase verbosity level. Currently 4 verbosity levels are
	available: default (which only prints error information), normal
	(which prints information about the produced object, -v), medium
	(which prints information about what the program is doing, -v -v)
	and high (which prints all available information, -v -v -v).

  -a	change alignment value to which multiple segments combigned into
	a single segment should be aligned (must be either 1, 2, 4, 8,
	16, 32 or 256. Default is 16).

  -s	strip exported symbols from output file. Symbols marked as
  	SYM_GLOBAL are never stripped.

  -x	warn about unresolved symbols.

  -xe	issue an error when at least one symbol is unresolved.

  -o name	write output to file <name>. The default output filename
		is 'aout.rdx'.

  -j path	specify search path for object files. Default path is a
  		current directory.

  -L path	specify search path for libraries. Default path is a
  		current directory.

  -g file	embed 'file' as a first header record with type 'generic'.


rdx
===

This program simply loads and executes an RDOFF object, by calling
'_main', which it expects to be a C-style function, which will accept
two parameters, argc and argv in normal C style.


rdflib
======

This program creates a library file for use with ldrdf.

It is supplied with a shell script 'makelib' which should probably be used
to create libraries.

Usage:
	rdflib command library [optional arguments]

Valid commands are:

	c	Create (or truncate) the library
	a	Add a module (requires a filename and a name to give the
		module, ie 'rdflib a libc.rdl strcpy.rdf strcpy' puts the
		file 'strcpy.rdf' into 'libc.rdl', and calls it 'strcpy'.
	x	Extract (arguments are the opposite to the 'a' command,
		ie you'd do 'rdflib x libc.rdl strcpy strcpy.rdf to get
		a copy of strcpy.rdf back out again...)
        t       List modules in the library
	d	Delete modules from library
	r	Replace a module in library with a new file


Library functions
=================

The files 'rdoff.c', 'rdoff.h', 'rdfload.c' and 'rdfload.h' contain
code which you may find useful. They retain the same interface as
the previous version, so any code that used them previously should
still work OK (maybe). 'rdoff.c' contains at the top a line:

#define STRICT_ERRORS

Comment this line out if you wish to use record types other than the
7 predefined types; it will then not report such records as an error,
but accept them gracefully, and read them byte for byte into
a 'generic record' (see the definition of GenericRec in 'rdoff.h').

If you are using these functions to write RDF modules (rather than
just reading them), then please note the existance of a new function
'rdfaddsegment(rdf_headerbuf,long)'. This must be called once for
each segment in your object, to tell the header writing functions
how long the segment is.


BUGS
====

This product has recently undergone a major revision, and as such there
are probably several bugs left over from the testing phase (although the
previous version had quite a few that have now been fixed!). Could you
please report any bugs to maintainers at the addresses below, including the
following information:

  - A description of the bug
  - What you think the program should be doing
  - Which programs you are using
  - Which operating system you are using, and which C compiler was used to
    compile the programs (or state that the pre-compiled versions were used).
  - If appropriate, any of the following:
    * source code (preferably cut down to a minimum that will still assemble
      and show the bug)
    * the output of rdfdump on produced modules (or send the module if the
      problem is in code generated)
    * exact descriptions of error messages/symptoms/etc


TODO
====

There are still various things unimplemented that we would like to add.
If you want to find out what these are, search near the top of each *.c
file for a comment containing the word 'TODO'. A brief list is given here:

- Improve the performace of ldrdf (there are several enhancements I can think
  of that wouldn't be too hard to add)
- Stop assuming that we're on a little endian machine
- Check for more bugs
