NASM, the Netwide Assembler
===========================

[![master](https://travis-ci.org/netwide-assembler/nasm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/netwide-assembler/nasm)

Many many developers all over the net respect NASM for what it is:
a widespread (thus netwide), portable (thus netwide!), very flexible
and mature assembler tool with support for many output formats (thus netwide!!).

Now we have good news for you: NASM is licensed under the "simplified"
[(2-clause) BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
This means its development is open to even wider society of programmers
wishing to improve their lovely assembler.

Visit our [nasm.us](https://www.nasm.us/) website for more details.
We are gradually moving services away from Sourceforge. For our remaining
Sourceforge services see [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm/).

With best regards, the NASM crew.
