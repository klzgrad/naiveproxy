To build the entire documentation, the following tools are needed:

1. A Perl interpreter for your platform
2. The following Perl modules available from CPAN:
   Font::TTF
   Sort::Versions
3. asciidoc
   http://asciidoc.org/
4. xmlto
   https://fedorahosted.org/xmlto
5. One of:
	Adobe Acrobat (acrodist)
	Ghostscript (ps2pdf) http://download.ghostscript.com/
	pstopdf	(available on some BSD-derived Unix systems)

	Of these, Ghostscript is the most tested, although Acrobat has
	been claimed to generate smaller files.
6. For best results, the Adobe fonts Source Sans Pro and Source Code
   Pro, available for free at:
   https://github.com/adobe-fonts
