// A surface ID is composed of two parts: a FrameSinkID, and a LocalSurfaceId.
// The FrameSinkId uniquely identifies the FrameSink associated with the
// surface. This corresponds to a SurfaceFactory in the display compositor
// service. The FrameSinkId is partially allocated by the display compositor
// and partially allocated by the frame source.
// The LocalSurfaceId are allocated by the client using any scheme
// that avoids duplicates and makes IDs unguessable respectively.
