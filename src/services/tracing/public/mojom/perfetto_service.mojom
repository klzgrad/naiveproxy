// Brief description of the flow: There's a per-process ProducerClient which
// connects to the central PerfettoService and establishes a two-way connection
// with a ProducerHost. The latter will then pass a SharedMemoryBuffer to the
// ProducerClient and tell it to start logging events of a given type into it.
// As chunks of the buffer get filled up, the client will communicate this to
// the ProducerHost, which will tell Perfetto to copy the finished chunks into
// its central storage and pass them on to its consumers.

// https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/perfetto/+/master/docs/life-of-a-tracing-session.md
