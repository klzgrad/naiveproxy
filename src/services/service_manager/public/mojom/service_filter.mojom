// intended for. Generally a ServiceFilter is used by the Service Manager to
// match against the Identity of each running service instance in order to
// perform some operation on that instance.
//
// The fields here correspond in meaning to the ones defined by Identity. See
// the comments there for more details. Note that if |globally_unique_id| is
// present, all other fields must be present as well.
