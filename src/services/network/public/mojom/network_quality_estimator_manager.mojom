  // at the transport layer provides an aggregate estimate of the transport RTT
  // as computed by various underlying TCP and QUIC connections. A negative
  // value of |http_rtt| implies that the RTT estimate was unavailable.
  // |downlink_bandwidth_kbps| is the current downlink throughput estimate (in
  // kilobits per second). A negative value of |downlink_bandwidth_kbps| implies
  // that the downlink throughput estimate was unavailable.
