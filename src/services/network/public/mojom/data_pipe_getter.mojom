// as backed by content like a Blob that can be read multiple times.

  // once the size of the content is known.  The callback must be invoked before
  // writing to |pipe|, since the size needs to be known to generate the
  // Content-Length request header. If an error occurred before the size was
  // known, the callback is instead called with the net::Error |status|.

  // operation.
