  //   1. A network connection becoming available or going away. For example
  //      plugging or unplugging an Ethernet cable, WiFi or cellular modem
  //      connecting or disconnecting from a network, or a VPN tunnel being
  //      established or taken down.
  //   2. An active network connection's IP address changes.
  //   3. A change to the local IP routing tables.
  // The signal is produced when the change is complete. For example if a new
  // network connection has become available, the signal is issued after OS has
  // finished establishing the connection (i.e. DHCP is done) to the point where
  // the new connection is usable. |type| indicates the type of the active
  // primary network connection after the change.  OnNetworkChanged will always
