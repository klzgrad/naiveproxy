  // The |format| describes the buffer format (check gfx::BufferFormat) in
  // fourcc form. The |planes_count| says how many planes the buffer, backed
  // by the |file| descriptor has. And the |buffer_id| is a unique id for the
  // buffer, which is used to identify imported wl_buffers on the browser
  // process side and map them with the buffer objects on the gpu process side.
  // The buffer will be associated with an AcceleratedWidget as soon as the

  // reassign it to another AcceleratedWidget.
