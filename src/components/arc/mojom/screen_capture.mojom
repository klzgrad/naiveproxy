// Mojo interface for performing screen capture in ChromeOS at the request of
// Android. Android does not have access to the full desktop for capture (it has
// access only to its Windows), so via this IPC mechanism it can request
// permissions to capture the entire desktop and then also perform that capture.

// The original version of this file lives in the Chromium repository at:
// src/components/arc/mojom/screen_capture.mojom

// Next MinVersion: 2

module arc.mojom;

// For gfx::Size.
import "components/arc/mojom/video_common.mojom";

// Implemented by Chrome in order to allow requesting of permissions to perform
// desktop capture as well as creating a session for it.
interface ScreenCaptureHost {
  // This will also show the desktop picker in case of multiple displays and
  // will then link that desktop window to the granted permission.
  // display_name is the string that should be used in the UI
  // package_name is what should be used as the permission token
  // returns true if the user accepts, false otherwise
  RequestPermission@0(string display_name, string package_name) => (bool granted);

  // Requests that a corresponding active permission dialog from a prior call to
  // RequestPermission be accepted. This will only be allowed under test
  // conditions.
  // package_name should match what was passed into RequestPermission
  [MinVersion=1] TestModeAcceptPermission@2(string package_name);

  // Starts a new capture session, binding the session interface to the passed
  // in session request.
  // notifier interface passed in will be used to send messages back to Android
  //     for when updates are needed by the Chrome rendering engine
  // package_name should correspond to what was passed into the
  //     RequestPermission call
  // size should have the width/height of the buffers used
  // returns null interface in the case the permission was not granted, a valid
  //     interface pointer otherwise

interface ScreenCaptureSession {
  // Called to set the graphics buffer that the screen capture should be
  // rendered to. This call does not return until the rendering is complete to
  // the passed in buffer.

  //     surface being rendered to
  // stride is the stride in pixels for each row of the buffer

// Implemented by Android.

  // actively rendering. This will occur if the Android windows are minimized or
  // not animating but Chrome windows are since Android’s rendering stack does
  // not update if nothing in Android itself is changing.
