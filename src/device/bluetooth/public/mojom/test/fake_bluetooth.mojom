//
// These interfaces are not intended to be used directly.
// `web-bluetooth-test.js` makes the Fake Bluetooth interface easier to work
// with.
// *   Calls are synchronous.
// *   IDs are cached.
//
// If another C++ client intends to use Fake Bluetooth a C++ wrapper similar to
// `web-bluetooth-test.js` should be created.
//
// When a Bluetooth service is created the `fake_bluetooth.mojom` and
// `bluetooth/test/fake_*` files should be removed and the client facing test
// wrapper `web-bluetooth-test.js` converted to implement the Bluetooth service
// as needed for tests.
//
// FakeBluetooth and its related interfaces allow clients to control the global
// Bluetooth State as well as simulate Bluetooth events including finding new
// devices, simulating GATT attributes and its descendants, and simulating
// success and error responses.
