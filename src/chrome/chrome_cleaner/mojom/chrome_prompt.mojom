module chrome_cleaner.mojom;

// This interface was used to communicate between Chrome and the Chrome Cleanup
// until M80, when it was replaced by
// components/chrome_cleaner/public/proto/chrome_prompt.proto. It must be
// supported until we drop support for Chrome M79 and earlier.

// IMPORTANT NOTE: Avoid adding dependencies to typemapped .mojom files outside
// the chrome/chrome_cleaner directory.  Enabling typemaps currently (as of
// July 2017) requires indirectly depending on all existing typemap
// definitions. The Chrome Cleaner is built independently from Chromium and
// would like to avoid these dependencies.

// Once it's possible to specify a limited subset of typemaps to use, be
// careful not to add dependencies to [Native] mojo structures. The wire format
// for [Native] structs is not guaranteed to be consistent between versions.
