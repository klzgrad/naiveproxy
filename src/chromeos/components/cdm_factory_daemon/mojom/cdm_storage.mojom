module chromeos.cdm.mojom;

// Provides a interface for per-origin/cdm storage handled by Chrome. This is
// meant to translate to the media/mojo/mojom/cdm_storage.mojom interface that
// is in Chrome but is tied more closely to the Widevine CE CDM IStorage
// interface on this end. This one exists for the purpose of being able to do
// version management so we can handle version diffs between Chrome and
// Chrome OS.
// Next Method ID: 5
