// This interface is implemented by ash-chrome. It allows lacros-chrome to query
// information about existing windows, screens, and displays.

// This interface cannot be used to make changes to screens, windows or
// displays. That's because Wayland is the protocol for that, and attempting to
// introduce another protocol would require careful synchronization between the
// two, which we'd like to avoid.
//
// TODO(https://crbug.com/1094460): This is a very simple interface. We will
// likely want to replace it with a more feature-complete and performant
// interface in the future.

  // of this method takes a screenshot and converts it into a bitmap. Each
  // pixel is represented by 4 bytes [RGBA].

  // The media screen capture implementation assumes that every platform
  // provides a synchronous method to take a snapshot of the screen.
