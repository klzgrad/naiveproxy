  (Documentation based on the Mozilla documentation currently at
  http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Effective_TLD_Service, written by the same
  author.)

  The RegistryControlledDomainService examines the hostname of a GURL passed to
  it and determines the longest portion that is controlled by a registrar.
  Although technically the top-level domain (TLD) for a hostname is the last
  dot-portion of the name (such as .com or .org), many domains (such as co.uk)
  function as though they were TLDs, allocating any number of more specific,
  essentially unrelated names beneath them.  For example, .uk is a TLD, but
  nobody is allowed to register a domain directly under .uk; the "effective"
  TLDs are ac.uk, co.uk, and so on.  We wouldn't want to allow any site in
  *.co.uk to set a cookie for the entire co.uk domain, so it's important to be
  able to identify which higher-level domains function as effective TLDs and
  which can be registered.

  The service obtains its information about effective TLDs from a text resource
  that must be in the following format:

  * It should use plain ASCII.
  * It should contain one domain rule per line, terminated with \n, with nothing
    else on the line.  (The last rule in the file may omit the ending \n.)
  * Rules should have been normalized using the same canonicalization that GURL
    applies.  For ASCII, that means they're not case-sensitive, among other
    things; other normalizations are applied for other characters.
  * Each rule should list the entire TLD-like domain name, with any subdomain
    portions separated by dots (.) as usual.
  * Rules should neither begin nor end with a dot.
  * If a hostname matches more than one rule, the most specific rule (that is,
    the one with more dot-levels) will be used.
  * Other than in the case of wildcards (see below), rules do not implicitly
    include their subcomponents.  For example, "bar.baz.uk" does not imply
    "baz.uk", and if "bar.baz.uk" is the only rule in the list, "foo.bar.baz.uk"
    will match, but "baz.uk" and "qux.baz.uk" won't.
  * The wildcard character '*' will match any valid sequence of characters.
  * Wildcards may only appear as the entire most specific level of a rule.  That
    is, a wildcard must come at the beginning of a line and must be followed by
    a dot.  (You may not use a wildcard as the entire rule.)
  * A wildcard rule implies a rule for the entire non-wildcard portion.  For
    example, the rule "*.foo.bar" implies the rule "foo.bar" (but not the rule
    "bar").  This is typically important in the case of exceptions (see below).
  * The exception character '!' before a rule marks an exception to a wildcard
    rule.  If your rules are "*.tokyo.jp" and "!pref.tokyo.jp", then
    "a.b.tokyo.jp" has an effective TLD of "b.tokyo.jp", but "a.pref.tokyo.jp"
    has an effective TLD of "tokyo.jp" (the exception prevents the wildcard
    match, and we thus fall through to matching on the implied "tokyo.jp" rule
    from the wildcard).
  * If you use an exception rule without a corresponding wildcard rule, the
    behavior is undefined.

  Firefox has a very similar service, and it's their data file we use to
  construct our resource.  However, the data expected by this implementation
  differs from the Mozilla file in several important ways:
   (1) We require that all single-level TLDs (com, edu, etc.) be explicitly
       listed.  As of this writing, Mozilla's file includes the single-level
       TLDs too, but that might change.
   (2) Our data is expected be in pure ASCII: all UTF-8 or otherwise encoded
       items must already have been normalized.
   (3) We do not allow comments, rule notes, blank lines, or line endings other
       than LF.
  Rules are also expected to be syntactically valid.

  The utility application tld_cleanup.exe converts a Mozilla-style file into a
  Chrome one, making sure that single-level TLDs are explicitly listed, using
  GURL to normalize rules, and validating the rules.
