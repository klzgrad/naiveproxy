// This file intentionally does not have header guards, it's included
// inside a macro to generate values. The following line silences a

// no-include-guard-because-multiply-included
// NOLINT(build/header_guard)

// This is the list of load flags and their values. For the enum values,
// include the file "net/base/load_flags.h".
//
// Here we define the values using a macro LOAD_FLAG, so it can be
// expanded differently in some places (for example, to automatically
// map a load flag value to its symbolic name).

LOAD_FLAG(NORMAL, 0)

// This is "normal reload", meaning an if-none-match/if-modified-since query.
// All other caches are used as normal.
LOAD_FLAG(VALIDATE_CACHE, 1 << 0)

// This is "shift-reload", meaning a "pragma: no-cache" end-to-end fetch.
// The response is not read from the HTTP cache but is written to the cache,
// unlike in `DISABLE_CACHE`. All other caches are used as normal.
LOAD_FLAG(BYPASS_CACHE, 1 << 1)

// This is a back/forward style navigation where the cached content should
// be preferred over any protocol specific cache validation.
LOAD_FLAG(SKIP_CACHE_VALIDATION, 1 << 2)

// This is a navigation that will fail if it cannot serve the requested
// resource from the cache (or some equivalent local store).
LOAD_FLAG(ONLY_FROM_CACHE, 1 << 3)

// This is a request whose response will not be read or written to the HTTP
// cache. It does not impact the cache-related HTTP request headers. All other
// caches are used as normal.
LOAD_FLAG(DISABLE_CACHE, 1 << 4)

// If present, causes dependent network fetches (AIA, CRLs, OCSP) to be
// skipped on secure connections.
LOAD_FLAG(DISABLE_CERT_NETWORK_FETCHES, 1 << 5)

// This load will not make any changes to cookies, including storing new
// cookies or updating existing ones.
// Deprecated. Use URLRequest::set_allow_credentials instead. See
// https://crbug.com/799935.
LOAD_FLAG(DO_NOT_SAVE_COOKIES, 1 << 6)

// Do not resolve proxies. This override is used when downloading PAC files
// to avoid having a circular dependency.
LOAD_FLAG(BYPASS_PROXY, 1 << 7)

// DO NOT USE THIS FLAG
// The network stack should not have frame level knowledge.  Any pre-connect
// or pre-resolution requiring that knowledge should be done from the
// stack embedder.
// Indicate that this is a top level frame, so that we don't assume it is a
// subresource and speculatively pre-connect or pre-resolve when a referring
// page is loaded.
LOAD_FLAG(MAIN_FRAME_DEPRECATED, 1 << 8)

// Indicates that this load was motivated by the rel=prefetch feature, or the
// speculationrules prefetch feature, and is (in theory) not intended for the
// current frame.
LOAD_FLAG(PREFETCH, 1 << 9)

// Indicates that this load could cause deadlock if it has to wait for another
// request. Overrides socket limits. Must always be used with MAXIMUM_PRIORITY.
LOAD_FLAG(IGNORE_LIMITS, 1 << 10)

// Indicates that the username:password portion of the URL should not
// be honored, but that other forms of authority may be used.
LOAD_FLAG(DO_NOT_USE_EMBEDDED_IDENTITY, 1 << 11)

// Indicates that this request is not to be migrated to a cellular network when
// QUIC connection migration is enabled.
LOAD_FLAG(DISABLE_CONNECTION_MIGRATION_TO_CELLULAR, 1 << 12)

// Indicates that the cache should not check that the request matches the
// response's vary header.
LOAD_FLAG(SKIP_VARY_CHECK, 1 << 13)

// The creator of this URLRequest wishes to receive stale responses when allowed
// by the "Cache-Control: stale-while-revalidate" directive and is able to issue
// an async revalidation to update the cache. If the callee needs to revalidate
// the resource |async_revalidation_requested| attribute will be set on the
// associated HttpResponseInfo. If indicated the callee should revalidate the
// resource by issuing a new request without this flag set. If the revalidation
// does not complete in 60 seconds, the cache treat the stale resource as
// invalid, as it did not specify stale-while-revalidate.
LOAD_FLAG(SUPPORT_ASYNC_REVALIDATION, 1 << 14)

// Indicates that a prefetch request's cached response should be restricted in
// in terms of reuse. The cached response can only be reused by requests with
// the LOAD_CAN_USE_RESTRICTED_PREFETCH_FOR_MAIN_FRAME load flag.
LOAD_FLAG(RESTRICTED_PREFETCH_FOR_MAIN_FRAME, 1 << 15)

// This flag must be set on requests that are allowed to reuse cache entries
// that are marked as RESTRICTED_PREFETCH_FOR_MAIN_FRAME. Requests without this
// flag cannot reuse restricted prefetch responses in the cache. Restricted
// response reuse is considered privileged, and therefore this flag must only be
// set from a trusted process.
LOAD_FLAG(CAN_USE_RESTRICTED_PREFETCH_FOR_MAIN_FRAME, 1 << 16)

// Indicates that this load can use a shared dictionary.
LOAD_FLAG(CAN_USE_SHARED_DICTIONARY, 1 << 17)

// Indicates that CAN_USE_SHARED_DICTIONARY must be disabled after a redirect to
// another origin.
LOAD_FLAG(DISABLE_SHARED_DICTIONARY_AFTER_CROSS_ORIGIN_REDIRECT, 1 << 18)

// This flag is used to bypass HSTS upgrades. This flag must be set for AIA,
// CRL, and OCSP requests in order to prevent circular dependencies.
LOAD_FLAG(SHOULD_BYPASS_HSTS, 1 << 19)
