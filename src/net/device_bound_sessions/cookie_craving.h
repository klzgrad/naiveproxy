// This class represents the need for a certain cookie to be present. It is not
// a cookie itself, but rather represents a requirement which can be satisfied
// by a real cookie (i.e. a CanonicalCookie). Each CookieCraving is specified by
// and associated with a DBSC (Device Bound Session Credentials) session.
//
// In general, CookieCraving behavior is intended to be as close as possible to
// CanonicalCookie, especially the inclusion logic, since they need to be
// matched up. However, some notable differences include:
//
// CookieCraving does not have a value field, i.e. they only have a name (and
// other attributes). The name can be the empty string. The name of a cookie is
// needed to identify it, but the value of a cookie is not relevant to its
// inclusion or exclusion, so CookieCraving omits it.
//
// CookieCraving does not have an expiry date. The expiry date of a
// CanonicalCookie often depends upon the creation time (if it is set via
// Max-Age), and a DBSC session config is not necessarily created at the same
// time as its corresponding Set-Cookie header, so we cannot guarantee that
// they'd match. DBSC also does not require a specific expiry date for the
// cookies whose presence it guarantees.
//
// CookieCraving does not implement lax-allow-unsafe behavior (it does not
// set a non-zero age threshold for it). The default CanonicalCookie
// lax-allow-unsafe behavior is problematic because it can result in two
// identical set-cookie lines (set from the same URL) exhibiting different
// inclusion results, if they happen to be on opposite sides of the
// lax-allow-unsafe age threshold. By not implementing lax-allow-unsafe,
// CookieCraving may sometimes be excluded even when a corresponding
// CanonicalCookie would be included for being under its lax-allow-unsafe age
// threshold. This means that servers deploying DBSC with SameSite-unspecified
// cookies SHOULD NOT rely on the presence of SameSite-unspecified cookies
// within 2 minutes of their creation time on cross-site POST and other unsafe
// request types, as DBSC cannot make any such guarantee.
class NET_EXPORT CookieCraving : public CookieBase {
 public:
  // Creates a new CookieCraving in the context of `url`, given a `name` and
  // associated cookie `attributes`. (Note that CookieCravings do not have a
  // "value".) `url` must be valid. `creation_time` may not be null. May return
  // a SessionError if the CookieCraving is invalid, such as if an attribute
  // value is invalid. If a CookieCraving is returned, it will satisfy
  // IsValid(). If there is leading or trailing whitespace in `name`, it will
  // get trimmed.
  //
  // Partitioned cookies are not supported. Attempts to create a
  // partitioned CookieCraving will fail.
  //
  // SameSite and HttpOnly related parameters are not checked here,
  // so creation of CookieCravings with e.g. SameSite=Strict from a cross-site
  // context is allowed. Create() also does not check whether `url` has a secure
  // scheme if attempting to create a Secure cookie. The Secure, SameSite, and
  // HttpOnly related parameters should be checked when deciding CookieCraving
  // inclusion for a given request/context.
  //
  // In general this is intended to closely mirror CanonicalCookie::Create.
  // However, there are some simplifying assumptions made*, and metrics are not
  // (currently) logged so as to not interfere with CanonicalCookie metrics.
  // There is also no (current) need for a CookieInclusionStatus to be returned.
  //
  // * Simplifying assumptions (differing from CanonicalCookie):
  //  - The Domain() member of a CookieCraving is required to be non-empty,
  //    which CanonicalCookie does not require.
  //  - Cookie name prefixes (__Host- and __Secure-) are always checked
  //    case-insensitively, unlike CanonicalCookie which reads a Feature value
  //    to decide whether to check insensitively.
  //  - CanonicalCookie allows non-cryptographic URLs to create a cookie with a
  //    secure source_scheme, if that cookie was Secure, on the basis that that
  //    URL might be trustworthy when checked later. CookieCraving does not
  //    allow this.
