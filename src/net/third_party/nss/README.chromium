This directory includes a single function that was historically derived from
NSS's libssl, from the hg repo at hg tag NSS_3_23_RTM:
  https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss

The CPEPrefix field is intentionally omitted because this code no longer shares
fate with NSS. This is derived code, not than a vendored dependency.

Local Modifications:
The function has been rewritten using Chromium's libraries and Chromium's
certificate verifier.
