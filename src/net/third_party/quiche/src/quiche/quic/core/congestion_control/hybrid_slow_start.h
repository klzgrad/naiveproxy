// This class is a helper class to TcpCubicSender.
// Slow start is the initial startup phase of TCP, it lasts until first packet
// loss. This class implements hybrid slow start of the TCP cubic send side
// congestion algorithm. The key feaure of hybrid slow start is that it tries to
// avoid running into the wall too hard during the slow start phase, which
// the traditional TCP implementation does.
// This does not implement ack train detection because it interacts poorly with
// pacing.
