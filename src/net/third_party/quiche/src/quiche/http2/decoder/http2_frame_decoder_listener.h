// Http2FrameDecoderListener is the interface which the HTTP/2 decoder uses
// to report the decoded frames to a listener.
//
// The general design is to assume that the listener will copy the data it needs
// (e.g. frame headers) and will keep track of the implicit state of the
// decoding process (i.e. the decoder maintains just the information it needs in
// order to perform the decoding). Therefore, the parameters are just those with
// (potentially) new data, not previously provided info about the current frame.
//
// The calls are described as if they are made in quick succession, i.e. one
// after another, but of course the decoder needs input to decode, and the
// decoder will only call the listener once the necessary input has been
// provided. For example: OnDataStart can only be called once the 9 bytes of
// of an HTTP/2 common frame header have been received. The decoder will call
// the listener methods as soon as possible to avoid almost all buffering.
//
// The listener interface is designed so that it is possible to exactly
// reconstruct the serialized frames, with the exception of reserved bits,
// including in the frame header's flags and stream_id fields, which will have
// been cleared before the methods below are called.
