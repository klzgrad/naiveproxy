// 1. Every Actor object appears at most once in the event queue, for one
//    specific time.
// 2. Actor is scheduled by calling Schedule() method.

//    Act() method will be called at the earliest time specified.
// 4. Before Act() is called, the Actor is removed from the event queue.  Act()
//    will not be called again unless Schedule() is called.
