A Deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) is a compact
representation of an unordered word list (dictionary).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton

This python program converts a list of strings to a byte array in C++.
This python program fetches strings and return values from a gperf file
and generates a C++ file with a byte array representing graph that can be
used as a memory efficient replacement for the perfect hash table.

The input strings are assumed to consist of printable 7-bit ASCII characters
and the return values are assumed to be one digit integers.

In this program a DAFSA is a diamond shaped graph starting at a common
source node and ending at a common sink node. All internal nodes contain
a label and each word is represented by the labels in one path from
the source node to the sink node.

The following python represention is used for nodes:

  Source node: [ children ]
  Internal node: (label, [ children ])
  Sink node: None

The graph is first compressed by prefixes like a trie. In the next step
suffixes are compressed so that the graph gets diamond shaped. Finally
one to one linked nodes are replaced by nodes with the labels joined.

The order of the operations is crucial since lookups will be performed
starting from the source with no backtracking. Thus a node must have at
most one child with a label starting by the same character. The output
is also arranged so that all jumps are to increasing addresses, thus forward
in memory.

The generated output has suffix free decoding so that the sign of leading
bits in a link (a reference to a child node) indicate if it has a size of one,
two or three bytes and if it is the last outgoing link from the actual node.
A node label is terminated by a byte with the leading bit set.

The generated byte array can described by the following BNF:

<byte> ::= < 8-bit value in range [0x00-0xFF] >

<char> ::= < printable 7-bit ASCII character, byte in range [0x20-0x7F] >
<end_char> ::= < char + 0x80, byte in range [0xA0-0xFF] >
<return value> ::= < value + 0x80, byte in range [0x80-0x8F] >

<offset1> ::= < byte in range [0x00-0x3F] >
<offset2> ::= < byte in range [0x40-0x5F] >
<offset3> ::= < byte in range [0x60-0x7F] >

<end_offset1> ::= < byte in range [0x80-0xBF] >
<end_offset2> ::= < byte in range [0xC0-0xDF] >
<end_offset3> ::= < byte in range [0xE0-0xFF] >

<prefix> ::= <char>

<label> ::= <end_char>
          | <char> <label>

<end_label> ::= <return_value>
          | <char> <end_label>

<offset> ::= <offset1>
           | <offset2> <byte>
           | <offset3> <byte> <byte>

<end_offset> ::= <end_offset1>
               | <end_offset2> <byte>
               | <end_offset3> <byte> <byte>

<offsets> ::= <end_offset>
            | <offset> <offsets>

<source> ::= <offsets>

<node> ::= <label> <offsets>
         | <prefix> <node>
         | <end_label>

<dafsa> ::= <source>
          | <dafsa> <node>

Decoding:

<char> -> printable 7-bit ASCII character
<end_char> & 0x7F -> printable 7-bit ASCII character
<return value> & 0x0F -> integer
<offset1 & 0x3F> -> integer
((<offset2> & 0x1F>) << 8) + <byte> -> integer
((<offset3> & 0x1F>) << 16) + (<byte> << 8) + <byte> -> integer

end_offset1, end_offset2 and and_offset3 are decoded same as offset1,
offset2 and offset3 respectively.

The first offset in a list of offsets is the distance in bytes between the
offset itself and the first child node. Subsequent offsets are the distance
between previous child node and next child node. Thus each offset links a node
to a child node. The distance is always counted between start addresses, i.e.
first byte in decoded offset or first byte in child node.

Example 1:

%%
aa, 1
a, 2
%%

The input is first parsed to a list of words:
["aa1", "a2"]

A fully expanded graph is created from the words:
source = [node1, node4]
node1 = ("a", [node2])
node2 = ("a", [node3])
node3 = ("\x01", [sink])
node4 = ("a", [node5])
node5 = ("\x02", [sink])
sink = None

Compression results in the following graph:
source = [node1]
node1 = ("a", [node2, node3])
node2 = ("\x02", [sink])
node3 = ("a\x01", [sink])
sink = None

A C++ representation of the compressed graph is generated:

const unsigned char dafsa[7] = {
  0x81, 0xE1, 0x02, 0x81, 0x82, 0x61, 0x81,
};

The bytes in the generated array has the following meaning:

 0: 0x81 <end_offset1>  child at position 0 + (0x81 & 0x3F) -> jump to 1

 1: 0xE1 <end_char>     label character (0xE1 & 0x7F) -> match "a"
 2: 0x02 <offset1>      child at position 2 + (0x02 & 0x3F) -> jump to 4

 3: 0x81 <end_offset1>  child at position 4 + (0x81 & 0x3F) -> jump to 5
 4: 0x82 <return_value> 0x82 & 0x0F -> return 2

 5: 0x61 <char>         label character 0x61 -> match "a"
 6: 0x81 <return_value> 0x81 & 0x0F -> return 1

Example 2:

%%
aa, 1
bbb, 2
baa, 1
%%

The input is first parsed to a list of words:
["aa1", "bbb2", "baa1"]

Compression results in the following graph:
source = [node1, node2]
node1 = ("b", [node2, node3])
node2 = ("aa\x01", [sink])
node3 = ("bb\x02", [sink])
sink = None

A C++ representation of the compressed graph is generated:

const unsigned char dafsa[11] = {
  0x02, 0x83, 0xE2, 0x02, 0x83, 0x61, 0x61, 0x81, 0x62, 0x62, 0x82,
};

The bytes in the generated array has the following meaning:

 0: 0x02 <offset1>      child at position 0 + (0x02 & 0x3F) -> jump to 2
 1: 0x83 <end_offset1>  child at position 2 + (0x83 & 0x3F) -> jump to 5

 2: 0xE2 <end_char>     label character (0xE2 & 0x7F) -> match "b"
 3: 0x02 <offset1>      child at position 3 + (0x02 & 0x3F) -> jump to 5
 4: 0x83 <end_offset1>  child at position 5 + (0x83 & 0x3F) -> jump to 8

 5: 0x61 <char>         label character 0x61 -> match "a"
 6: 0x61 <char>         label character 0x61 -> match "a"
 7: 0x81 <return_value> 0x81 & 0x0F -> return 1

 8: 0x62 <char>         label character 0x62 -> match "b"
 9: 0x62 <char>         label character 0x62 -> match "b"
10: 0x82 <return_value> 0x82 & 0x0F -> return 2
