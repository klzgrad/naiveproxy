// An adapter to convert between StreamSocket and OpenSSL BIO I/O models.
//
// BIO exposes a UNIX-like interface where BIO_read and BIO_write may either
// succeed synchronously or be retried (with no memory between calls).
// StreamSocket exposes an asynchronous interface where an asynchronous
// operation continues running and completes with a callback.
//
// For reading, SocketBIOAdapter maintains a buffer to pass to
// StreamSocket::Read. Once that Read completes, BIO_read synchronously drains
// the buffer and signals BIO_should_read once empty.
//
// For writing, SocketBIOAdapter maintains a ring buffer of data to be written
// to the StreamSocket. BIO_write synchronously copies data into the buffer or
// signals BIO_should_write if the buffer is full. The ring buffer is drained
// asynchronously into the socket. Note this means write errors are reported at
// a later BIO_write.
//
// To work around this delay, write errors are also surfaced out of
// BIO_read. Otherwise a failure in the final BIO_write of an application may go
// unnoticed. If this occurs, OnReadReady will be signaled as if it were a read
// error. See https://crbug.com/249848.

  //
  // Callers should implement these methods and, when signaled, retry the
  // BIO_read or BIO_write. This usually is done by retrying a higher-level
  // operation, such as SSL_read or SSL_write.

  // Callers may assume that OnReadReady and OnWriteReady will only be called
