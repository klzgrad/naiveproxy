// HttpStream provides an abstraction for a basic http streams, SPDY, and QUIC.
// The HttpStream subtype is expected to manage the underlying transport
// appropriately.  For example, a basic http stream will return the transport
// socket to the pool for reuse.  SPDY streams on the other hand leave the
// transport socket management to the SpdySession.
