// otherwise lose watch time data. See the WatchTimeReporter for more details on

// Values will be recorded to UMA and UKM upon requesting finalization or the
// destruction of the WatchTimeRecorder binding.
//
// Note: Not all values recorded by UKM are recorded by UMA. See implementations
// for more details; specifically WatchTimeRecorder::ShouldReportToUma().
//
// Note: There are some UMA values that the WatchTimeRecorder will generate
// based on the recorded keys and values. Such metrics will only be generated
// when finalizing everything via FinalizeWatchTime({}) or destruction.
