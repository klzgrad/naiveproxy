Usage: naive { OPTIONS | [/path/to/config.json] }

Description:

    naive is a proxy to transport traffic as Chromium traffic. It can be
    used as both the client and the server or together.

    There are two ways to specify options. The first is through command
    line flags: naive OPTIONS. The second is through a JSON
    configuration file. If there are no command line flags or path
    specified, it will try to read from "config.json" by default.

    The syntax of config.json fields are mapped exactly to command line
    flags, e.g.

        {
          "proxy": "https://user:pass@example.org"
        }

    is exactly the same as --proxy=https://user:pass@example.org.  All
    command line flags must have string values in config.json, except if
    the flags are boolean then they must have boolean values too.

Options:

    -h, --help

        Shows help message.

    --version

        Prints version

    --listen=<proto>://[addr][:port]

        Listens at addr:port with protocol <proto>. Allowed values for
        proto: "socks", "http", "redir". The default proto is socks.
        The default addr is 0.0.0.0. The default port is 1080.

        For redirecting local traffic from the same machine:

        iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d ... -j REDIRECT --to-ports 1080

        For redirecting forwarded traffic on a router:

        iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d ... -j REDIRECT --to-ports 1080

    --proxy=<proto>://[<user>:<pass>@]<hostname>[:<port>]

        Routes traffic via the proxy server. Allowed values for proto:
        "https", "quic". The value of port is inferred from proto if not
        specified.

        If this option is not set, connects to origin server directly.

    --padding

        Obfuscates traffic by adding length paddings.

    --host-resolver-rules=...

        This is the same as Chromium's flag of the same name. Google it
        as the full description is too technical.

    --log=[<path>]

        Saves log to the file at <path>. If <path> is empty, prints to
        console.

        If this option is not set, no log is saved for privacy.

    --log-net-log=<path>

        Saves NetLog. View at https://netlog-viewer.appspot.com/.

    --ssl-key-log-file=<path>

        Saves SSL keys for Wireshark inspection.
